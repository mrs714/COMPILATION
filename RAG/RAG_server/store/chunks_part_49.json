FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The sustained commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to mutual defense has made possible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can and should play a critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era in creating the stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in Europe.\u201c(2) Lasting stability and security in Europe requires the military, economic, and political integration of emerging democracies into existing European structures.\u201c(3) In an era of threats from terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is increasingly contributing to security in the face of global security challenges for the protection and interests of its member states.\u201c(4) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103\u201344722 U.S.C. 1928\u201c(5) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title VI of section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law 104\u201320822 U.S.C. 1928\u201c(6) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of division G of Public Law 105\u201327722 U.S.C. 1928\u201c(7) In the Gerald B.

We also commend their contribution to regional stability and cooperation. We want all three countries to succeed and will continue to assist them in their reform efforts. NATO will continue to assess each country\u2019s candidacy individually, based on the progress made towards reform goals pursued through the Membership Action Plan, which will remain the vehicle to keep the readiness of each aspirant for membership under review. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep the enlargement process, including the implementation of the Membership Action Plan, under continual review and report to us. We will review at the next Summit progress by aspirants towards membership based on that report\u2019.\u201c(16) Georgia and Ukraine have stated their desire to join the Euro-Atlantic community, and in particular, are seeking to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.", " Georgia and Ukraine are working closely with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its members to meet criteria for eventual membership in NATO.\u201c(17) At a press conference with President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia in Washington, D.C. on July 5, 2006\u201c(18) Following a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in New York on September 21, 2006\u201c(19) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Summit in Brussels in February 2005, President of Ukraine Victor Yushchenko declared membership in NATO as the ultimate goal of Ukraine\u2019s cooperation with the Alliance and expressed Ukraine\u2019s desire to conclude a Membership Action Plan.\u201c(20) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Foreign Ministerial meeting in Vilnius in April 2005, NATO and Ukraine launched an Intensified Dialogue on the potential membership of Ukraine in NATO.\u201c(21) At the Riga Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in November 2006, the Heads of State and Government of the member countries of NATO issued a declaration reaffirming that NATO\u2019s door remains open to new members, declaring that \u2018all European democratic countries may be considered for MAP (Membership Action Plan) or admission, subject to decision by the NAC (North Atlantic Council) at each stage, based on the performance of these countries towards meeting the objectives of the North Atlantic Treaty. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep that process under continual review and report to us. We welcome the efforts of Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to prepare themselves for the responsibilities and obligations of membership. We reaffirm that the Alliance will continue with Georgia and Ukraine its Intensified Dialogues which cover the full range of political, military, financial and security issues relating to those countries\u2019 aspirations to membership, without prejudice to any eventual Alliance decision.

Accordingly, the United States and its NATO allies should make this intention clear in negotiations with Russia, including negotiations regarding adaptation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty of November 19, 1990\u201c(2) Limitations on commitments to russiaIn seeking to demonstrate to Russia NATO\u2019s defensive and security-enhancing intentions, it is essential that neither fundamental United States security interests in Europe nor the effectiveness and flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance be jeopardized.

In particular, the United States and its NATO allies should seek to cooperate with Russia in such areas as early warning.\u201c(2) Discussions with nato alliesThe United States should initiate discussions with its NATO allies for the purpose of examining the feasibility of deploying a ballistic missile defense capable of protecting NATO\u2019s southern and eastern flanks from a limited ballistic missile attack.\u201c(3) Constitutional prerogativesEven as the Congress seeks to promote ballistic missile defense cooperation with Russia, it must insist on its constitutional prerogatives regarding consideration of arms control agreements with Russia that bear on ballistic missile defense.\u201cSEC. 2703.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996\u2019.\u201cSEC. 602. FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and its partners in the Alliance.\u201c(2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to", " include as full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. America\u2019s security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to the security of the countries of Europe.\u201c(3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creating the stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully complete political and economic transformation.\u201c(4) The United States continues to regard the political independence and territorial integrity of all emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace and security.\u201c(5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those countries seeking NATO membership.\u201c(6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different occasions since 1949.\u201c(7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new members into NATO.\u201c(8) Lasting security and stability in Europe requires not only the military integration of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe into existing European structures, but also the eventual economic and political integration of these countries into existing European structures.\u201c(9) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the enlargement process will require current member", "s of NATO, and the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making available the resources necessary to supplement efforts prospective new members are themselves undertaking.\u201c(10) New members will be full members of the Alliance, enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington on April 4, 1949\u201c(11) In order to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO to be prepared to assume the responsibilities of NATO membership, the United States should encourage and support efforts by such countries to develop force structures and force modernization priorities that will enable such countries to contribute to the full range of NATO missions, including, most importantly, territorial defense of the Alliance.\u201c(12) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force, can make an important contribution to European peace and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can assist those countries preparing to assume the responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly should receive appropriate support from the United States.\u201c(13) NATO remains the only multilateral security organization capable of conducting effective military operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region.\u201c(14) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a positive role in defusing tensions between members of the Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred between two Alliance member states since the inception of NATO in 1949.\u201c(15) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which are", " found to be in a position to further the principles of the Washington Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance the security of the region. Countries which have become democracies and established market economies, which practice good neighborly relations, and which have established effective democratic civilian control over their defense establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the principles of the Washington Treaty.\u201c(16) Democratic civilian control of defense forces is an essential element in the process of preparation for those states interested in possible NATO membership.\u201c(17) Protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights is an integral aspect of genuine security, and in evaluating requests for membership in NATO, the human rights records of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be evaluated according to their commitments to fulfill in good faith the human rights obligations of the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the Helsinki Final Act.\u201c(18) A number of Central and Eastern European countries have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.\u201c(19) The Caucasus region remains important geographically and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United States and NATO should continue to examine means to strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of United Nations recognized countries in that region.\u201c(20) In recognition that not all countries which have requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\u201c(21) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance should include those emerging democracies most ready for closer ties with NATO and shou", "ld be designed to assist other countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward eventual NATO membership.\u201c(22) The Congress of the United States finds in particular that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made significant progress toward achieving the criteria set forth in section 203(d)(3) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103\u2013447\u201c(23) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO\u2019s security and the approval of all NATO members.\u201c(24) The process of NATO enlargement entails the consensus agreement of the governments of all 16 NATO members and ratification in accordance with their constitutional procedures.\u201c(25) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory although they are accorded the full collective security guarantees provided by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO members, particularly in the current security climate. However, NATO retains the right to alter its security posture at any time as circumstances warrant.\u201cSEC. 603. UNITED STATES POLICY.\u201cIt is the policy of the United States\u2014\u201c(1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War world;\u201c(2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership;\u201c(3) to support the enlargement of NATO in recognition that enlargement will benefit the interests of the United States and the Alliance and to consider these benefits in any analysis of the costs of NATO enlargement;\u201c(4) to ensure that all countries in Central and Eastern Europe are fully aware of and capable of assuming the costs and responsibilities of NATO mem", "bership, including the obligation set forth in Article 10 of the Washington Treaty that new members be able to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area; and\u201c(5) to work to define a constructive and cooperative political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian Federation.\u201cSEC. 604. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER ENLARGEMENT OF NATO.\u201cIt is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine\u2014\u201c(1) the United States should continue and expand its support for the full and active participation of these countries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO membership;\u201c(2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic means available to press the European Union to admit as soon as possible any country which qualifies for membership;\u201c(3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Russia; and\u201c(4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance.\u201cSEC. 605. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA AND LITHUANIA.\u201cIn view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50 years, it is the sense of the Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical security concerns that must be taken into account by the United States; and\u201c(2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their forcible incorporation into the So", "viet Union.\u201cSEC. 606.

The Security regulations of these three treaty organizations provide that each participating nation shall be responsible for the security screening and security clearance of its own citizens before they are authorized access to the Organization\u2019s TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information. There is no existing program, however, under which United States civilians who are hired directly by these organizations can be screened and cleared for access to such Organization\u2019s TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information while so employed. It is, of course, in the interest of the United States that United States citizens who participate in the activities of NATO, SEATO, and CENTO as direct hire employees of the civil or military agencies of those organizations be reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The sustained commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to mutual defense has made possible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can and should play a critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era in creating the stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in Europe.\u201c(2) Lasting stability and security in Europe requires the military, economic, and political integration of emerging democracies into existing European structures.\u201c(3) In an era of threats from terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is increasingly contributing to security in the face of global security challenges for the protection and interests of its member states.\u201c(4) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law 103\u201344722 U.S.C. 1928\u201c(5) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title VI of section 101(c) of ", "title I of division A of Public Law 104\u201320822 U.S.C. 1928\u201c(6) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of division G of Public Law 105\u201327722 U.S.C. 1928\u201c(7) In the Gerald B.

The door to membership remains open. We welcome the progress made by Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1) [sic] in implementing their Annual National Programmes under the Membership Action Plan, and encourage them to continue pursuing the reforms necessary to progress toward NATO membership. We also commend their contribution to regional stability and cooperation. We want all three countries to succeed and will continue to assist them in their reform efforts. NATO will continue to assess each country\u2019s candidacy individually, based on the progress made towards reform goals pursued through the Membership Action Plan, which will remain the vehicle to keep the readiness of each aspirant for membership under review. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep the enlargement process, including the implementation of the Member", "ship Action Plan, under continual review and report to us. We will review at the next Summit progress by aspirants towards membership based on that report\u2019.\u201c(16) Georgia and Ukraine have stated their desire to join the Euro-Atlantic community, and in particular, are seeking to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Georgia and Ukraine are working closely with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its members to meet criteria for eventual membership in NATO.\u201c(17) At a press conference with President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia in Washington, D.C. on July 5, 2006\u201c(18) Following a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in New York on September 21, 2006\u201c(19) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Summit in Brussels in February 2005, President of Ukraine Victor Yushchenko declared membership in NATO as the ultimate goal of Ukraine\u2019s cooperation with the Alliance and expressed Ukraine\u2019s desire to conclude a Membership Action Plan.\u201c(20) At the NATO-Ukraine Commission Foreign Ministerial meeting in Vilnius in April 2005, NATO and Ukraine launched an Intensified Dialogue on the potential membership of Ukraine in NATO.\u201c(21) At the Riga Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in November 2006, the Heads of State and Government of the member countries of NATO issued a declaration reaffirming that NATO\u2019s door remains open to new members, declaring that \u2018all European democratic countries may be considered for MAP (Membership Action Plan) or admission, subject to decision by the NAC (North Atlantic Council) at each stage, based on the performance of these countries towards meeting the objectives of the North Atlantic Treaty. We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep that process under continual review and report to us. We welcome the efforts of Albania, Croatia, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to prepare themselves for the responsibilities and obligations of membership. We reaffirm that the Alliance will continue with Georgia and Ukraine its Intensified Dialogues which cover the full range of political,", " military, financial and security issues relating to those countries\u2019 aspirations to membership, without prejudice to any eventual Alliance decision. We reaffirm the importance of the NATO-Ukraine Distinctive Partnership, which has its 10th anniversary next year and welcome the progress that has been made in the framework of our Intensified Dialogue. We appreciate Ukraine\u2019s substantial contributions to our common security, including through participation in NATO-led operations and efforts to promote regional cooperation. We encourage Ukraine to continue to contribute to regional security. We are determined to continue to assist, through practical cooperation, in the implementation of far-reaching reform efforts, notably in the fields of national security, defence, reform of the defence-industrial sector and fighting corruption. We welcome the commencement of an Intensified Dialogue with Georgia as well as Georgia\u2019s contribution to international peacekeeping and security operations. We will continue to engage actively with Georgia in support of its reform process. We encourage Georgia to continue progress on political, economic and military reforms, including strengthening judicial reform, as well as the peaceful resolution of outstanding conflicts on its territory. We reaffirm that it is of great importance that all parties in the region should engage constructively to promote regional peace and stability.\u2019.\u201c(22) Contingent upon their continued implementation of democratic, defense, and economic reform, and their willingness and ability to meet the responsibilities of membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a clear expression of national intent to do so, Congress calls for the timely admission of Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia (FYROM), and Ukraine to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to promote security and stability in Europe. \u201cSEC. 3.

Accordingly, the United States and its NATO allies should make this intention clear in negotiations with Russia, including negotiations regarding adaptation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty of November 19, 1990\u201c(2) Limitations on commitments to russiaIn seeking to demonstrate to Russia NATO\u2019s defensive and security-enhancing intentions, it is essential that neither fundamental United States security interests in Europe nor the effectiveness and flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance be jeopardized. In particular, no commitments should be made to Russia that would have the effect of\u2014\u201c(A) extending rights or imposing responsibilities on new NATO members different from those applicable to current NATO members, including rights or responsibilities with respect to the deployment of nuclear weapons and the stationing of troops and equipment from other NATO members;\u201c(B) limiting the ability of NATO to defend the territory of new NATO members by, for example, restricting the construction of defense infrastructure or limiting the ability of NATO to deploy necessary reinforcements;\u201c(C) providing any international organization, or any country that is not a member of NATO, with authority to delay, veto, or otherwise impede deliberations and decisions of the North Atlantic Council or the implementation of such decisions, including deliberations and decisions with respect to the deployment of NATO forces or the admission of additional members to NATO;\u201c(D) impeding the development of enhanced relations between NATO and other European countries that do not belong to the Alliance;\u201c(E) establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in Central or Eastern Europe;\u201c(F) requiring NATO to subsidize Russian arms sales, service, or support to the militaries of those former Warsaw Pact countries invited to join the Alliance; or\u201c(G) legitimizing Russian efforts to link conc", "essions in arms control negotiations to NATO enlargement.\u201c(3) Commitments from russiaIn order to enhance security and stability in Europe, the United States should seek commitments from Russia\u2014\u201c(A) to demarcate and respect all its borders with neighboring states;\u201c(B) to achieve the immediate and complete withdrawal of any armed forces and military equipment under the control of Russia that are deployed on the territories of the independent states of the former Soviet Union without the full and complete agreement of those states;\u201c(C) to station its armed forces on the territory of other states only with the full and complete agreement of that state and in strict accordance with international law; and\u201c(D) to take steps to reduce further its nuclear and conventional forces in Kaliningrad.\u201c(4) ConsultationsAs negotiations on adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe proceed, the United States should engage in close and continuous consultations not only with its NATO allies, but also with the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine, and the South Caucasus.\u201c(c) Policy With Respect to Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation\u201c(1) In generalAs the United States proceeds with efforts to develop defenses against ballistic missile attack, it should seek to foster a climate of cooperation with Russia on matters related to missile defense. In particular, the United States and its NATO allies should seek to cooperate with Russia in such areas as early warning.\u201c(2) Discussions with nato alliesThe United States should initiate discussions with its NATO allies for the purpose of examining the feasibility of deploying a ballistic missile defense capable of protecting NATO\u2019s southern and eastern flanks from a limited ballistic missile attack.\u201c(3) Constitutional prerogativesEven as the Congress seeks to promote ballistic missile defense cooperation with Russia, it must insist on its constitutional prerogatives regarding consideration of arms control agreements with Russia that bear on ballistic ", "missile defense. \u201cSEC. 2703.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996\u2019. \u201cSEC. 602. FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and its partners in the Alliance.\u201c(2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. America\u2019s security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to the securit", "y of the countries of Europe.\u201c(3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creating the stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully complete political and economic transformation.\u201c(4) The United States continues to regard the political independence and territorial integrity of all emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace and security.\u201c(5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those countries seeking NATO membership.\u201c(6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different occasions since 1949.\u201c(7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new members into NATO.\u201c(8) Lasting security and stability in Europe requires not only the military integration of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe into existing European structures, but also the eventual economic and political integration of these countries into existing European structures.\u201c(9) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making available the resources necessary to supplement efforts prospective new members are themselves undertaking.\u201c(10) New members will be full members of the Alliance, enjoying all rights a", "nd assuming all the obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington on April 4, 1949\u201c(11) In order to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO to be prepared to assume the responsibilities of NATO membership, the United States should encourage and support efforts by such countries to develop force structures and force modernization priorities that will enable such countries to contribute to the full range of NATO missions, including, most importantly, territorial defense of the Alliance.\u201c(12) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force, can make an important contribution to European peace and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can assist those countries preparing to assume the responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly should receive appropriate support from the United States.\u201c(13) NATO remains the only multilateral security organization capable of conducting effective military operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region.\u201c(14) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a positive role in defusing tensions between members of the Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred between two Alliance member states since the inception of NATO in 1949.\u201c(15) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a position to further the principles of the Washington Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance the security of the region. Countries which have become democracies and established market economies, which practice good neighborly relations, and which have established effective democratic civilian control over their defense establishments and attain", "ed a degree of interoperability with NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the principles of the Washington Treaty.\u201c(16) Democratic civilian control of defense forces is an essential element in the process of preparation for those states interested in possible NATO membership.\u201c(17) Protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights is an integral aspect of genuine security, and in evaluating requests for membership in NATO, the human rights records of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be evaluated according to their commitments to fulfill in good faith the human rights obligations of the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the Helsinki Final Act.\u201c(18) A number of Central and Eastern European countries have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.\u201c(19) The Caucasus region remains important geographically and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United States and NATO should continue to examine means to strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of United Nations recognized countries in that region.\u201c(20) In recognition that not all countries which have requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\u201c(21) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance should include those emerging democracies most ready for closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward eventual NATO membership.\u201c(22) The Congress of the United States finds in particular that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made significant progress toward achieving the criteria set forth in section 203(d)(3) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103\u2013447\u201c", "(23) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO\u2019s security and the approval of all NATO members.\u201c(24) The process of NATO enlargement entails the consensus agreement of the governments of all 16 NATO members and ratification in accordance with their constitutional procedures.\u201c(25) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory although they are accorded the full collective security guarantees provided by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO members, particularly in the current security climate.

Congressional findings and declaration of policy", "\n(a) United States development cooperation policyThe Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world\u2019s limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.United States development cooperation policy should emphasize five principal goals:(1) the alleviation of the worst physical manifestations of poverty among the world\u2019s poor majority;(2) the promotion of conditions enabling developing countries to achieve self-sustaining economic growth with equitable distribution of benefits;(3) the encouragement of development processes in which individual civil and economic rights are respected and enhanced;(4) the integration of the developing countries into an open and equitable international economic system; and(5) the promotion of good governance through combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability.The Congress declares that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United States foreign policy and that United States development resources be effectively and efficiently utilized.(b) Coordination of d", "evelopment-related activitiesUnder the policy guidance of the Secretary of State, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should have the responsibility for coordinating all United States development-related activities.(Pub.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) On June 24, 2002\u201c(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001\u201c(3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by United States law from receiving United States assistance because it has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for purposes of [former] section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) [former 50 U.S.C. 4605(j)(1)\u201c(4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and ", "reports that Syria provides \u2018safe haven and support to several terrorist groups\u2019, fewer United States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect to any other country that is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.\u201c(5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\u2014General Command, maintain

withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.\u201c(9) On March 3, 2003\u201c(10) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.\u201c(11) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978\u201c(12) Even in the face of this United Nations certification that acknowledged Israel\u2019s full compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah continues to attack Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the pretense that Shebaa Farms is territory from which Israel was required to withdraw by Security Counsel Resolution 425, and Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah and other militant organizations continue to attack civilian targets in Israel.\u201c(13) Syria will not allow Lebanon\u2014a sovereign country\u2014to fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council Resolution 425 to deploy ", "its troops to southern Lebanon.\u201c(14) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which continues to attack Israeli positions, allows Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate freely in the area, and maintains thousands of rockets along Israel\u2019s northern border, destabilizing the entire region.\u201c(15) On February 12, 2003\u201c(16) In the State of the Union address on January 29,

Security Council Resolution 661, which restricted the sale of oil and other commodities by Saddam Husse", "in\u2019s regime, except to the extent authorized by other relevant resolutions, but this pledge was never fulfilled.\u201c(26) Syria\u2019s illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil during Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime earned Syria $50,000,000 or more per month as Syria continued to sell its own Syrian oil at market prices.\u201c(27) Syria\u2019s illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil earned Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime $2,000,000 per day.\u201c(28) On March 28,

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018African Conflict Resolution Act\u2019.\u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\u201c(a) FindingsThe Con", "gress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution\u2014\u201c(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;\u201c(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and\u201c(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.\u201c(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.\u201c(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.\u201c(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa\u2019s future.\u201c(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa\u2019s children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.\u201c(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.\u201c(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and", " other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.\u201c(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.\u201c(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.\u201c(10) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.\u201c(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the experience of elder statesmen. Groups such as the All African Council of Churches have assisted in defusing conflicts. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has sought to address the conflict in Liberia by deploying an African peacekeeping force. The Southern African states have been working to prevent a crisis in Lesotho. The Intergovernmental Authority on Desertification and Drought (IGADD) has been engaged in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan.\u201c(12) The Organization of African Unity, under the leadership of Secretary General Salim Salim, has established a conflict resolution mechanism and has been active in mediation and conflict resolution in several African countries.\u201c(b) United States PolicyThe Congress declares, therefore, that a key goal for United States foreign policy should be to help institutionalize conflict resolution capability in Africa.\u201cSEC. 3.

This focus is reflected in our National Security Strategy, the Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, and the 2010 U.S. Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. Evidence demonstrates that women\u2019s empowerment is critical to building stable, democratic societies; to supporting open and accountable governance; to furthering international peace and security; to growing vibrant market economies; and to addressing pressing health and education challenges.(c) Preventing and responding to gender-based violence is a cornerstone of my Administration\u2019s commitment to advance gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Such violence significantly hinders the ability of individuals to fully participate in, and contribute to, their communities\u2014economically, politically, and socially. It is a human rights violation or abuse; a public health ch", "allenge; and a barrier to civic, social, political, and economic participation.

Executive departments and agencies (agencies) with international development programs must now build upon the recent progress made pursuant to these orders by systematically factoring climate-resilience considerations into international development strategies, planning, programming, investments, and related funding decisions, including ", "the planning for and management of overseas facilities.This order requires the integration of climate-resilience considerations into all United States international development work to the extent permitted by law. Dedicated U.S. climate-change adaptation funds are critical to managing the risks posed by climate-change impacts in vulnerable countries. Coping with the magnitude of the consequences of accelerating climate change also requires enhanced efforts across the Federal Government\u2019s broader international development work. Consideration of current and future climate-change impacts will improve the resilience of the Federal Government\u2019s broader international development programs, projects, investments, overseas facilities, and related funding decisions. The United States will also promote a similar approach among relevant multilateral entities in which it participates.By taking these steps and more fully considering current and future climate-change impacts, the United States will foster better decision-making processes and risk-management approaches, ensure the effectiveness of U.S. investments, and assist other countries in integrating climate-resilience considerations into their own development planning and implementation. Collectively, these efforts will help to better optimize broader international development work and lead to enhanced global preparedness for and resilience to climate change.The international climate-resilience actions required by this order complement efforts by the Federal Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home and globally. The more greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the less need there will be to adapt to the impacts of a changing climate.SecIncorporating Climate Resilience into International Development(i) incorporate climate-resilience considerations into decisionmaking by:(A) assessing and evaluating climate-related risks to and vulnerabilities in agency strategies, planning, programs, projects, investments, overseas facilities, and related funding decisions, usin", "g best-available climate-change data, tools, and information, including those identified or developed pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of this order; and(B) as appropriate, adjusting strategies, planning, programs, projects, investments, and related funding decisions, including the planning for and management of overseas facilities, based on such assessments and evaluations;(ii) collaborate with other agencies to share knowledge, data, tools, information, frameworks, and lessons learned in incorporating climate-resilience considerations into agency strategy, planning, programs, projects, investments, and related funding decisions, including the planning for and management of overseas facilities;(iii) work with other countries, as appropriate, to identify climate risks and incorporate climate-resilience considerations into their international development assistance efforts;(iv) when determining how to use resources, support efforts of vulnerable countries to integrate climate-resilience considerations into national, regional, and sectoral development planning and action; and(v) monitor progress in integrating and promoting climate-resilient development considerations as required by this subsection.(b) Agencies that participate in multilateral entities and other agencies with representation in multilateral development entities, including multilateral development banks and United Nations organizations, shall, as appropriate:(i) work to encourage multilateral entities to:(A) assess and evaluate climate-related risks to and vulnerabilities in their strategies, planning, programs, projects, investments, and related funding decisions, using best-available climate-change data, tools, and information; and(B) adjust their strategies, planning, programs, projects, investments, and related funding decisions, as appropriate, based on such assessments and evaluations;(ii) collaborate with multilateral entities and share with agencies and other stakeholders knowledge, data, tools, information, frameworks, and lessons learned from t", "he multilateral entities in incorporating climate-resilience considerations into strategies, planning, programs, projects, investments, and related funding decisions;(iii) encourage multilateral entities to support efforts of vulnerable countries to integrate climate-resilience considerations into national, regional, and sectoral development planning and action; and(iv) monitor the efforts of multilateral entities in integrating climate-resilient development considerations as encouraged by this order.SecEnhancing Data, Tools, and Information for Climate-Resilient International DevelopmentSecWorking Group on Climate-Resilient International DevelopmentEstablishment(b) Mission and Function(i) The Working Group shall:(A) develop, for agencies with direct international development programs and investments, guidelines for integrating considerations of climate-change risks and climate resilience into agency strategies, plans, programs, projects, investments, and related funding decisions, including the planning for and management of overseas facilities;(B) assess and identify, for agencies with direct international development programs and investments, existing climate-change data, tools, and information, as described in section 3 of this order, to help agencies assess climate risks and make decisions that incorporate climate-resilience considerations, such as through project screening.

Ensuring that women and girls, including those most marginalized, are able to participate fully in public life, are free from violence, and have equal access to education, economic opportunity, and health care increases broader economic prosperity, as well as political stability and security.During my Administration, the United States has made promoting gender equality and advancing the status of women and girls a central element of our foreign policy, including by leading through example at home. Executive Order 13506 of March 11, 2009To elevate and integrate this strategic focus on the promotion of gender equality and the advancement of women and girls around the world, executive departments and agencies (agencies) have issued policy and operational guidance.

Many low- and middle-income countries lack adequate access to high-quality financing that meets their long-term infrastructure investment needs. Too often, financing options lack transparency, fuel corruption and poor governance, and create unsustainable debt burdens, often leading to projects that exploit, rather than empower, workers; ", "exacerbate challenges faced by vulnerable populations, such as forced displacement; degrade natural resources and the environment; threaten economic stability; undermine gender equality and human rights; and put insufficient focus on cybersecurity best practices\u2014a failure that can contribute to vulnerable information and communications technology networks.The underinvestment in infrastructure is not just financial, but also technical. Delivering high-quality infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries must include helping to establish and improve the necessary institutional and policy frameworks, regulatory environment, and human capacity to ensure the sustainable delivery of services to communities; defining strong engineering, environmental, social, governance, and labor standards; and structuring projects to attract private investment. Through the PGII, the United States and like-minded partners will emphasize high-standards and quality investments in resilient infrastructure that will drive job creation, safeguard against corruption, guarantee respect for workers\u2019 organizations and collective bargaining as allowed by national law or similar mechanisms, support inclusive economic recovery, address risks of environmental degradation, promote robust cybersecurity, promote skills transfer, and protect American economic prosperity and national security. The PGII will also advance values-driven infrastructure development that is carried out in a transparent and sustainable manner\u2014financially, environmentally, and socially\u2014to lead to better outcomes for recipient countries and communities.There is bipartisan support for international infrastructure development. The Congress passed the Better Utilization of Investments Leading to Development Act of 2018 (BUILD Act) (Division F of Public Law 115\u2013254132 Stat. 348522 U.S.C. 9601In a similar spirit, in 2018 the Congress passed the AGOA and MCA Modernization Act (Public Law 115\u2013167132 Stat. 1276section 3701 of Title 19The United States and its partners have a long ", "history of providing high-quality financing and technical support for infrastructure projects throughout the world. However, the lack of a comprehensive approach for coordinating infrastructure investments with like-minded partners often leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for coordinated investments to deliver at scale. Greater flexibility, speed, and resources, combined with expanded internal coordination within the United States Government, will provide opportunities for the United States Government and United States companies to better meet the infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries around the world. At the same time, greater coordination with G7 and other like-minded partners will increase efficiency and catalyze new financing to advance a shared vision of values driven, high-quality, and sustainable infrastructure around the world.Four key priorities relating to infrastructure will be especially critical for robust development in the coming decades: climate and energy security, digital connectivity, health and health security, and gender equality and equity. Economic prosperity and competitiveness will largely be driven by how well countries harness their digital and technology sectors and transition to clean energy to provide environmentally sustainable and broadly shared, inclusive growth for their people. Countries not only will need new and retrofitted infrastructure, secure clean energy supply chains, and secure access to critical minerals and metals to facilitate energy access and transitions to clean energy, but also will need significant investments in infrastructure to make communities more resilient to diverse threats, from pandemics to malicious cyber actors, to the increasing effects of climate change. Further, the COVID\u201319 pandemic has highlighted the unequal infrastructure needs in the developing world and has disproportionately affected low- and middle-income countries and regions, particularly with respect to the health sector.In the developing world, the pande", "mic has also set back the economic participation of women and members of underserved communities and has reversed decades of progress toward ending poverty, with global extreme poverty rising for the first time in more than 20 years due to COVID\u201319. The pandemic has highlighted the need for expanded investments in and high-quality financing for strengthened health systems to both fight the current pandemic and prepare for future health crises.It is therefore the policy of the United States to catalyze international infrastructure financing and development through the PGII, which is designed to offer low- and middle-income countries a comprehensive, transparent, values-driven financing choice for infrastructure development to advance climate and energy security, digital connectivity, health and health security, and gender equality and equity priorities. The PGII will mobilize public and private resources to meet key infrastructure needs, while enhancing American competitiveness in international infrastructure development and creating good jobs at home and abroad.

Therefore, a secure, peaceful, and prosperous Democratic Republic of the Congo would have a profound impact on progress throughout Africa.\u201c(5) The most recent war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which erupted in 1998, spawned some of the world\u2019s worst human rights atrocities and drew in six neighboring countries.\u201c(6) Despite the conclusion of a peace agreement and subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, both the real and perceived presence of armed groups hostile to the Governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi continue to serve as a major source of regional instability and an apparent pretext for continued interference in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by its neighbors.\u201c(7) A mortality study completed in December 2004 by the International Rescue Committee found that 31,000 people were dying monthly and 3,800,000 people had died in the previous six years because of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and resulting disinte", "gration of the social service infrastructure, making this one of the deadliest conflicts since World War II.\u201c(8) In 2004, Amnesty International estimated that at least 40,000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1998, and nearly two-thirds of ongoing abuses against women and girls are perpetrated by members of the security forces, particularly the Forces Armes de la Republique Democratique du Congo (FARDC) and the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC).\u201c(9) According to the Department of State, \u2018returning one of Africa\u2019s largest countries [the Democratic Republic of the Congo] to full peace and stability will require significant United States investments in support of national elections, the reintegration of former combatants, the return and reintegration of refugees and [internally displaced persons], establishment of central government control over vast territories, and promotion of national reconciliation and good governance\u2019. \u201cSEC. 102.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) On June 24, 2002\u201c(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001\u201c(3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by United States law from receiving United States assistance because it has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for purposes of [former] section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) [former 50 U.S.C. 4605(j)(1)\u201c(4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides \u2018safe haven and support to several terrorist groups\u2019, fewer United States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect to any other country that is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.\u201c(5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\u2014General Command, maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory, and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran through Syria.\u201c(6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982\u201c(7) Approximately 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining its political independence.\u201c(8) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have passed seven bills and resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.\u201c(9) On March 3, 2003\u201c(10) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.\u201c(11) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978\u201c(", "12) Even in the face of this United Nations certification that acknowledged Israel\u2019s full compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah continues to attack Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the pretense that Shebaa Farms is territory from which Israel was required to withdraw by Security Counsel Resolution 425, and Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah and other militant organizations continue to attack civilian targets in Israel.\u201c(13) Syria will not allow Lebanon\u2014a sovereign country\u2014to fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.\u201c(14) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which continues to attack Israeli positions, allows Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate freely in the area, and maintains thousands of rockets along Israel\u2019s northern border, destabilizing the entire region.\u201c(15) On February 12, 2003\u201c(16) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002\u201c(17) The Government of Syria continues to develop and deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.\u201c(18) According to the December 2001 unclassified Central Intelligence Agency report entitled \u2018Foreign Missile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat through 2015\u2019, \u2018Syria maintains a ballistic missile and rocket force of hundreds of FROG rockets, Scuds, and SS\u201321 SRBMs [and] Syria has developed [chemical weapons] warheads for its Scuds\u2019.\u201c(19) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development and production of biological and chemical weapons and has a nuclear research and development program that is cause for concern.\u201c(20) According to the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s \u2018Unclassified Report to Congress on the

January 7, 2003\u201c(23) Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 UST 483), which entered force on March 5, 1970\u201c(24) Syria is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention or the Biological Weapons Convention, which entered into force on April 29, 1997March 26, 1975\u201c(25) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised Secretary of State Powell in February 2001 to end violations of Security Council Resolution 661, which restricted the sale of oil and other commodities by Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, except to the extent authorized by other relevant resolutions, but this pledge was never fulfilled.\u201c(26) Syria\u2019s illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil during Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime earned Syria $50,000,000 or more per month as Syria continued to sell its own Syrian oil at market prices.\u201c(27) Syria\u2019s illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil earned Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime $2,000,000 per day.\u201c(28) On March 28, 2003\u201c(29) According to Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, members of the United Nations are elected as nonpermanent members of the United Nations Security Council with

The people of Zimbabwe have thus been denied the economic and democratic benefits envisioned by the donors to such programs, including the United States.\u201c(2) In September 1999 the IMF suspended its support under a \u2018Stand By Arrangement\u2019, approved the previous month, for economic adjustment and reform in Zimbabwe.\u201c(3) In October 1999, the International Development Association (in this section referred to as the \u2018IDA\u2019) suspended all structural adjustment loans, credits, and guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe.\u201c(4) In May 2000, the IDA suspended all other new lending to the Government of Zimbabwe.\u201c(5) In September 2000, the IDA suspended disbursement of funds for ongoing projects under previously-approved loans, credits, and guarantees to the Government of Zimbabwe.\u201c(6) In October 2016, the Government of Zimbabwe cleared a small hurdle in its longstanding public sector arrears with the IMF.\u201c(b) Support for Democratic Transition and Economic Recovery.\u2014\u201c(1) Bilateral debt reliefUpon receipt by the appropriate congressional committees of a certification described in subsection (d), the Secretary of the Treasury shall undertake a review of th", "e feasibility of restructuring, rescheduling, or eliminating the sovereign debt of Zimbabwe held by any agency of the United States Government.\u201c(2) Multilateral debt relief and other financial assistanceIt is the sense of Congress that, upon receipt by the appropriate congressional committees of a certification described in subsection (d), the Secretary of the Treasury should\u2014\u201c(A) direct the United States executive director of each multilateral development bank to support efforts to reevaluate plans to restructure, rebuild, reschedule, or eliminate Zimbabwe\u2019s sovereign debt held by that bank and provide an analysis based on reasonable financial options to achieve those goals; and\u201c(B) direct the United States executive director of each international financial institution to which the United States is a member to propose to undertake financial and technical support for Zimbabwe, especially support that is intended to promote Zimbabwe\u2019s economic recovery and development, the stabilization of the Zimbabwean currency, and the viability of Zimbabwe\u2019s democratic institutions.\u201c(c) Multilateral Financing RestrictionUntil the President makes the certification described in subsection (d), and except as may be required to meet basic human needs or for good governance, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States executive director to each international financial institution to oppose and vote against\u2014\u201c(1) any extension by the respective institution of any loan, credit, or guarantee to the Government of Zimbabwe; or\u201c(2) any cancellation or reduction of indebtedness owed by the Government of Zimbabwe to the United States or any international financial institution.\u201c(d) Presidential Certification That Certain Conditions Are SatisfiedA certification under this subsection is a certification transmitted to the appropriate congressional committees of a determination made by the President that the following conditions are satisfied:\u201c(1) Restoration of the rule of lawThe rule of law has been restored in Zimbabwe, inc", "luding respect for ownership and title to property, freedom of speech and association, and an end to the lawlessness, violence, and intimidation sponsored, condoned, or tolerated by the Government of Zimbabwe, the ruling party, and their supporters or entities.\u201c(2) Election or pre-election conditionsEither of the following two conditions is satisfied:\u201c(A) Presidential electionZimbabwe has held a presidential election that is widely accepted as free and fair by independent international monitors, and the president-elect is free to assume the duties of the office.\u201c(B) Pre-election conditionsIn the event the certification is made before the presidential election takes place, the Government of Zimbabwe has sufficiently improved the pre-election environment to a degree consistent with accepted international standards for security and freedom of movement and association.\u201c(3) Commitment to equitable, legal, and transparent land reformThe Government of Zimbabwe has demonstrated a commitment to an equitable, legal, and transparent land reform program.\u201c(4) Military and national police subordinate to civilian governmentThe Zimbabwean Armed Forces, the National Police of Zimbabwe, and other state security forces are responsible to and serve the elected civilian government.\u201c(e) WaiverThe President may waive the provisions of subsection (b)(1) or subsection (c), if the President determines that it is in the national interest of the United States to do so. \u201cSEC. 5.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018African Conflict Resolution Act\u2019. \u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution\u2014\u201c(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;\u201c(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and\u201c(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.\u201c(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since", " 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.\u201c(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.\u201c(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa\u2019s future.\u201c(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa\u2019s children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.\u201c(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.\u201c(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.\u201c(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.\u201c(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.\u201c(1", "0) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.\u201c(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the experience of elder statesmen. Groups such as the All African Council of Churches have assisted in defusing conflicts. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has sought to address the conflict in Liberia by deploying an African peacekeeping force. The Southern African states have been working to prevent a crisis in Lesotho. The Intergovernmental Authority on Desertification and Drought (IGADD) has been engaged in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan.\u201c(12) The Organization of African Unity, under the leadership of Secretary General Salim Salim, has established a conflict resolution mechanism and has been active in mediation and conflict resolution in several African countries.\u201c(b) United States PolicyThe Congress declares, therefore, that a key goal for United States foreign policy should be to help institutionalize conflict resolution capability in Africa. \u201cSEC. 3.

Development assistance policy(a) Principal purpose of bilateral development assistanceThe Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to build and maintain the social and economic institutions necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth and to provide opportunities to improve the quality of life for their people depend primarily upon successfully marshalling their own economic and human resources. The Congress recognizes that the magnitude of these efforts exceeds the resources of developing countries and therefore accepts that there will be a long-term need for wealthy countries to contribute additional resources for development purposes. The United States should take the lead in concert with other nations to mobilize such resources from public and private sources.Provision of development resources must be adapted to the needs and capabilities of specific developing countries. Unit", "ed States assistance to countries with low per capita incomes which have limited access to private external resources should primarily be provided on concessional terms. Assistance to other developing countries should generally consist of programs which facilitate their access to private capital markets, investment, and technical skills, whether directly through guarantee or reimbursable programs by the United States Government or indirectly through callable capital provided to the international financial institutions.Bilateral assistance and United States participation in multilateral institutions shall emphasize programs in support of countries which pursue development strategies designed to meet basic human needs and achieve self-sustaining growth with equity.The Congress declares that the principal purpose of United States bilateral development assistance is to help the poor majority of people in developing countries to participate in a process of equitable growth through productive work and to influence decisions that shape their lives, with the goal of increasing their incomes and their access to public services which will enable them to satisfy their basic needs and lead lives of decency, dignity, and hope. Activities shall be emphasized that effectively involve the poor in development by expanding their access to the economy through services and institutions at the local level, increasing their participation in the making of decisions that affect their lives, increasing labor-intensive production and the use of appropriate technology, expanding productive investment and services out from major cities to small towns and rural areas, and otherwise providing opportunities for the poor to improve their lives through their own efforts. Participation of the United States in multilateral institutions shall also place appropriate emphasis on these principles.(b) Form of assistance; principles governing assistanceAssistance under this part should be used not only for the purpose of transferring financial resources", " to developing countries, but also to help countries solve development problems in accordance with a strategy that aims to insure wide participation of the poor in the benefits of development on a sustained basis. Moreover, assistance shall be provided in a prompt and effective manner, using appropriate United States institutions for carrying out this strategy. In order to achieve these objectives and the broad objectives set forth in section 2151 of this title(1) Development is primarily the responsibility of the people of the developing countries themselves. Assistance from the United States shall be used in support of, rather than substitution for, the self-help efforts that are essential to successful development programs and shall be concentrated in those countries that take positive steps to help themselves. Maximum effort shall be made, in the administration of subchapter I of this chapter, to stimulate the involvement of the people in the development process through the encouragement of democratic participation in private and local governmental activities and institution building appropriate to the requirements of the recipient countries.(2) Development planning must be the responsibility of each sovereign country. United States assistance should be administered in a collaborative style to support the development goals chosen by each country receiving assistance.(3) United States bilateral development assistance should give high priority to undertakings submitted by host governments which directly improve the lives of the poorest of their people and their capacity to participate in the development of their countries, while also helping such governments enhance their planning, technical, and administrative capabilities needed to insure the success of such undertakings.(4) Development assistance provided under this part shall be concentrated in countries which will make the most effective use of such assistance to help satisfy basic human needs of poor people through equitable growth, especially in those co", "untries having the greatest need for outside assistance. In order to make possible consistent and informed judgments in this respect, the President shall assess the commitment and progress of countries in moving toward the objectives and purposes of this part by utilizing criteria, including but not limited to the following:(A) increase in agricultural productivity per unit of land through small-farm, labor-intensive agriculture;(B) reduction of infant mortality;(C) control of population growth;(D) promotion of greater equality of income distribution, including measures such as more progressive taxation and more equitable returns to small farmers;(E) reduction of rates of unemployment and underemployment;(F) increase in literacy; and(G) progress in combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability in the public and private sector.(5) United States development assistance should focus on critical problems in those functional sectors which affect the lives of the majority of the people in the developing countries; food production and nutrition; rural development and generation of gainful employment; population planning and health; environment and natural resources; education, development administration, and human resource development; and energy development and production.(6) United States assistance shall encourage and promote the participation of women in the national economies of developing countries and the improvement of women\u2019s status as an important means of promoting the total development effort.(7) United States bilateral assistance shall recognize that the prosperity of developing countries and effective development efforts require the adoption of an overall strategy that promotes the development, production, and efficient utilization of energy and, therefore, consideration shall be given to the full implications of such assistance on the price, availability, and consumption of energy in recipient countries.(8) United States cooperation in development should be carried out to the maximum e", "xtent possible through the private sector, including those institutions which already have ties in the developing areas, such as educational institutions, cooperatives, credit unions, free labor unions, and private and voluntary agencies.(9) To the maximum extent practicable, United States private investment should be encouraged in economic and social development programs to which the United States lends support.(10) Assistance shall be planned and utilized to encourage regional cooperation by developing countries in the solution of common problems and the development of shared resources.(11) Assistance efforts of the United States shall be planned and furnished to the maximum extent practicable in coordination and cooperation with assistance efforts of other countries, including the planning and implementation of programs and projects on a multilateral and multidonor basis.(12) United States bilateral development assistance should be concentrated on projects which do not involve large-scale capital transfers. However, to the extent that such assistance does involve large-scale capital transfers, it should be furnished in association with contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework.(13) United States encouragement of policy reforms is necessary if developing countries are to achieve economic growth with equity.(14) Development assistance should, as a fundamental objective, promote private sector activity in open and competitive markets in developing countries, recognizing such activity to be a productive and efficient means of achieving equitable and long term economic growth.(15) United States cooperation in development should recognize as essential the need of developing countries to have access to appropriate technology in order to improve food and water, health and housing, education and employment, and agriculture and industry.(16) United States assistance should focus on establishing and upgrading the institutional capacities of developing countries in order to promote lo", "ng term development. An important component of institution building involves training to expand the human resource potential of people in developing countries.(17) Economic reform and development of effective institutions of democratic governance are mutually reinforcing. The successful transition of a developing country is dependent upon the quality of its economic and governance institutions. Rule of law, mechanisms of accountability and transparency, security of person, property, and investments, are but a few of the critical governance and economic reforms that underpin the sustainability of broad-based economic growth. Programs in support of such reforms strengthen the capacity of people to hold their governments accountable and to create economic opportunity.(c) Worldwide cooperative effort to overcome aspects of absolute povertyThe Congress, recognizing the desirability of overcoming the worst aspects of absolute poverty by the end of this century by, among other measures, substantially lowering infant mortality and birth rates, and increasing life expectancy, food production, literacy, and employment, encourages the President to explore with other countries, through all appropriate channels, the feasibility of a worldwide cooperative effort to overcome the worst aspects of absolute poverty and to assure self-reliant growth in the developing countries by the year 2000.(Pub.

Women also tend to place a greater emphasis on household savings which improves family financial resiliency.\u201c(3) A 2016 report by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that achieving global gender parity in economic activity could add as much as $28,000,000,000,000 to annual global gross domestic product by 2025.\u201c(4) Lack of access to financial services that address gender-specific constraints impedes women\u2019s economic inclusion. Roughly 1,000,000,000 women around the world are currently left out of the formal financial system, which causes many women to rely on informal means of saving and borrowing that are riskier and less reliable.\u201c(5) Among other consequences, this lac", "k of access hampers the success of women entrepreneurs, including women who are seeking to run or grow small and medium-sized enterprises. The International Finance Corporation has estimated that 70 percent of women-owned small and medium-sized enterprises in the formal sector are unserved or underserved in terms of access to financial services, resulting in a financing gap of $300,000,000,000 for women-owned small businesses.\u201c(6) Women\u2019s economic empowerment is inextricably linked to a myriad of other women\u2019s human rights that are essential to their ability to thrive as economic actors across the lifecycle, including\u2014\u201c(A) living lives free of violence and exploitation;\u201c(B) achieving the highest possible standard of health and well-being;\u201c(C) enjoying full legal and human rights, such as access to registration, identification, and citizenship documents;\u201c(D) benefitting from formal and informal education;\u201c(E) equal protection of and access to land and property rights;\u201c(F) access to fundamental labor rights;\u201c(G) policies to address disproportionate care burdens; and\u201c(H) business and management skills and leadership opportunities.\u201c(7) Discriminatory legal and regulatory systems and banking practices are obstacles to women\u2019s access to capital and assets, including land, machinery, production facilities, technology, and human resources. These barriers are often connected to a woman\u2019s marital status, which can determine whether she is able to inherit land or own property in her name. These constraints contribute to women frequently running smaller businesses, with fewer employees and lower asset values.\u201c(8) Savings groups primarily comprised of women are recognized as a vital entry point, especially for poor and very poor women, to formal financial services. There is a high demand for such groups to protect and grow the savings of women with formal financial institutions.\u201c(9) Evidence shows that, once a saving group is linked to a bank, the average savings per member increases between 40 to 100 percent and the average ", "profit per member doubles. Investing in financial literacy, business leadership training, and mentorship are key elements to these outcomes.\u201c(10) United States support for microenterprise and microfinance development programs, which seek to reduce poverty in low-income countries by giving small loans to small-scale entrepreneurs without collateral, have been a useful mechanism to help families weather economic shocks, but many microcredit borrowers largely remain in poverty.\u201c(11) The vast majority of microcredit borrowers are women who would like to move up the economic ladder, but are held back by binding constraints that create a missing middle \u2013 large numbers of microenterprises, a handful of large firms or conglomerates, and very few small and medium-sized enterprises in between, which are critical to driving economic growth in developing countries.\u201c(12) According to the World Bank, small and medium-sized enterprises create 4 out of 5 new positions in emerging markets, but approximately 50 percent of formal small and medium-sized enterprises lack access to formal credit. The financing gap is even larger when micro and informal enterprises are taken into account. Overall, approximately 70 percent of all micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in emerging markets lack access to credit.\u201d \u00a7\u202f2151a. Agricultural development in rural areas(a) Authorization to President to furnish assistance; appropriations(1) In recognition of the fact that the great majority of the people of developing countries live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture and agricultural-related pursuits for their livelihood, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition\u2014(A) to alleviate starvation, hunger, and malnutrition;(B) to expand significantly the provision of basic services to rural poor people to enhance their capacity for self-help; and(C) to help create productive farm and off-farm employment in rural areas to provide a ", "more viable economic base and enhance opportunities for improved incomes, living standards, and contributions by rural poor people to the economic and social development of their countries.(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1987. Of these amounts, the President may use such amounts as he deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of section 316 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980. Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.(3) Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,000,000 shall be available only for the purpose of controlling and eradicating amblyomma variegatum (heartwater) in bovine animals in the Caribbean.(b) Use of assistance primarily in aid of rural poor; multilateral infrastructure projects; forestry proj\u00adects(1) Assistance provided under this section shall be used primarily for activities which are specifically designed to increase the productivity and income of the rural poor, through such means as creation and strengthening of local institutions linked to the regional and national levels; organization of a system of financial institutions which provide both savings and credit services to the poor; stimulation of small, labor-intensive enterprises in rural towns; improvement of marketing facilities and systems; expansion of rural infrastructure and utilities such as farm-to-market roads, water management systems, land improvement, energy, and storage facilities; establishment of more equitable and more secure land tenure arrangements; and creation and strengthening of systems to provide other services and supplies needed by farmers, such as extension, research, training, fertilizer, water, forestry, soil conservation, and improved seed, in ways which assure access to them by ", "small farmers.(2) In circumstances where development of major infrastructure is necessary to achieve the objectives set forth in this section, assistance for that purpose should be furnished under this part in association with significant contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework. Infrastructure proj\u00adects so assisted should be complemented by other measures to ensure that the benefits of the infrastructure reach the poor.(3) The Congress recognizes that the accelerating loss of forests and tree cover in developing countries undermines and offsets efforts to improve agricultural production and nutrition and otherwise to meet the basic human needs of the poor. Deforestation results in increased flooding, reduction in water supply for agricultural capacity, loss of firewood and needed wood products, and loss of valuable plants and animals. In order to maintain and increase forest resources, the President is authorized to provide assistance under this section for forestry projects which are essential to fulfill the fundamental purposes of this section. Emphasis shall be given to community woodlots, agroforestry, reforestation, protection of watershed forests, and more effective forest management.(c) Increased agricultural production in least developed countriesThe Congress finds that the greatest potential for significantly expanding availability of food for people in rural areas and augmenting world food production at relatively low cost lies in increasing the productivity of small farmers who constitute a majority of the agricultural producers in developing countries. Increasing the emphasis on rural development and expanded food production in the poorest nations of the developing world is a matter of social justice and a principal element contributing to broadly based economic growth, as well as an important factor in alleviating inflation in the industrialized countries. In the allocation of funds under this section, special attention shall be given to increasing agricultural", " production in countries which have been designated as \u201cleast developed\u201d by the United Nations General Assembly.(d) Coordination with population planning and health programsAssistance provided under this section shall also be used in coordination with programs carried out under section 2151b of this title(1) to devise and carry out in partnership with developing countries a strategy for programs of nutrition and health improvement for mothers and children, including breast feeding; and(2) to provide technical, financial, and material support to individuals or groups at the local level for such programs.(e) Use of local currency proceeds from sales of commoditiesLocal currency proceeds from sales of commodities provided under the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1691(f) National food security policies and programs; bilateral and multilateral assistanceThe Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to enhance their national food security deserves encouragement as a matter of United States development assistance policy. Measures complementary to assistance for expanding food production in developing countries are needed to help assure that food becomes increasingly available on a regular basis to the poor in such countries. Therefore, United States bilateral assistance under this chapter and the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1691(g) International Fund for Agricultural Development; participation and contributions; availability of appropriations(1) In order to carry out the purposes of this section, the President may continue United States participation in and may make contributions to the International Fund for Agricultural Development.(2) Of the aggregate amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out subchapter I of this chapter, up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 may be made available, by appropriation or by transfer, for United States contributions to the second replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.(Pub.

Population planning and health programs(a) Congressional declaration of policyThe Congress recognizes that poor health conditions and uncontrolled population growth can vitiate otherwise successful development efforts.Large families in developing countries are the result of complex social and economic factors which change relatively slowly among the poor majority least affected by economic progress, as well as the result of a lack of effective birth control. Therefore, effective family planning depends upon economic and social change as well as the delivery of services and is often a matter of political and religious sensitivity. While every country has the right to determine its own policies with respect to population growth, voluntary population planning programs can make a substantial contribution to economic development, higher living standards, and improved health and nutrition.Good health conditions are a principal element in improved quality of life and contribute to the individual\u2019s capacity to participate in the development process, while poor health and debilitating disease can limit productivity.(b) Assistance for voluntary population planningIn order to increase the opportunities and motivation for family planning and to reduce the rate of population growth, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditi", "ons as he may determine, for voluntary population planning. In addition to the provision of family planning information and services, including also information and services which relate to and support natural family planning methods, and the conduct of directly relevant demographic research, population planning programs shall emphasize motivation for small families.(c) Assistance for health programs; special health needs of children and mothers; Child Survival Fund; promotion of immunization and oral rehydration; control of AIDS and tuberculosis(1) In order to contribute to improvements in the health of the greatest number of poor people in developing countries, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for health programs. Assistance under this subsection shall be used primarily for basic integrated health services, safe water and sanitation, disease prevention and control, and related health planning and research. This assistance shall emphasize self-sustaining community-based health programs by means such as training of health auxiliary and other appropriate personnel, support for the establishment and evaluation of proj\u00adects that can be replicated on a broader scale, measures to improve management of health programs, and other services and supplies to support health and disease prevention programs.(2)(A) In carrying out the purposes of this subsection, the President shall promote, encourage, and undertake activities designed to deal directly with the special health needs of children and mothers. Such activities should utilize simple, available technologies which can significantly reduce childhood mortality, such as improved and expanded immunization programs, oral rehydration to combat diarrhoeal diseases, and education programs aimed at improving nutrition and sanitation and at promoting child spacing. In carrying out this paragraph, guidance shall be sought from knowledgeable health professionals from outside the agency primarily responsible for ad", "ministering subchapter I of this chapter. In addition to government-to-government programs, activities pursuant to this paragraph should include support for appropriate activities of the types described in this paragraph which are carried out by international organizations (which may include international organizations receiving funds under part III of this subchapter) and by private and voluntary organizations, and should include encouragement to other donors to support such types of activities.(B) In addition to amounts otherwise available for such purpose, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 for use in carrying out this paragraph. Amounts appropriated under this subparagraph are authorized to remain available until expended.(C) Appropriations pursuant to subparagraph (B) may be referred to as the \u201cChild Survival Fund\u201d.(3) The Congress recognizes that the promotion of primary health care is a major objective of the foreign assistance program. The Congress further recognizes that simple, relatively low cost means already exist to reduce incidence of communicable diseases among children, mothers, and infants. The promotion of vaccines for immunization, and salts for oral rehydration, therefore, is an essential feature of the health assistance program. To this end, the Congress expects the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter to set as a goal the protection of not less than 80 percent of all children, in those countries in which such agency has established development programs, from immunizable diseases by January 1, 1991(4) Relationship to other lawsAssistance made available under this subsection and sections 2151b\u20132, 2151b\u20133, and 2151b\u20134 of this title, and assistance made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter to carry out the purposes of this subsection and the provisions cited in this paragraph, may be made available notwithstanding any other provision of law that ", "restricts assistance to foreign countries, except for the provisions of this subsection, the provisions of law cited in this paragraph, subsection (f), section 2394\u20131 of this titlePublic Law 108\u20137(d) Administration of assistance(1) Assistance under this part shall be administered so as to give particular attention to the interrelationship between (A) population growth, and (B) development and overall improvement in living standards in developing countries, and to the impact of all programs, projects, and activities on population growth. All appropriate activities proposed for financing under this part shall be designed to build motivation for smaller families through modification of economic and social conditions supportive of the desire for large families, in programs such as education in and out of school, nutrition, disease control, maternal and child health services, improvements in the status and employment of women, agricultural production, rural development, and assistance to the urban poor, and through community-based development programs which give recognition to people motivated to limit the size of their families. Population planning programs shall be coordinated with other programs aimed at reducing the infant mortality rate, providing better nutrition for pregnant women and infants, and raising the standard of living of the poor.(2) Since the problems of malnutrition, disease, and rapid population growth are closely related, planning for assistance to be provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section and under section 2151a of this title(3) Assistance provided under this section shall emphasize low-cost integrated delivery systems for health, nutrition, and family planning for the poorest people, with particular attention to the needs of mothers and young children, using paramedical and auxiliary medical personnel, clinics and health posts, commercial distribution systems, and other modes of community outreach.(e) Research and analysis(1) Health and population research and analysis carried ou", "t under this chapter shall\u2014(A) be undertaken to the maximum extent practicable in developing countries by developing country personnel, linked as appropriate with private and governmental biomedical research facilities within the United States;(B) take account of the special needs of the poor people of developing countries in the determination of research priorities; and(C) make extensive use of field testing to adapt basic research to local conditions.(2) The President is authorized to study the complex factors affecting population growth in developing countries and to identify factors which might motivate people to plan family size or to space their children.(f) Prohibition on use of funds for performance or research respecting abortions or involuntary sterilization(1) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.(2) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilizations as a method of family planning or to coerce or provide any financial incentive to any person to undergo sterilizations.(3) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for any biomedical research which relates, in whole or in part, to methods of, or the performance of, abortions or involuntary sterilization as a means of family planning.(g) Authorization of appropriations(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes\u2014(A) $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (b) of this section; and(B) $205,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $180,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (c) of this section.(2) Funds appropriated under this subsection are authorized to remain available until expended.(Pub.

This is complicated in the United States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/AIDS.\u201c(5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the United States attributable to foreign-born persons, tuberculosis will never be controlled in the United States until it is co", "ntrolled abroad.\u201c(6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.\u201c(7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by several barriers, including\u2014\u201c(A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in screening, detecting, and treating the disease;\u201c(B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease;\u201c(C) the unique circumstances in each country, which requires the development and implementation of country-specific programs; and\u201c(D) the risk of having a bad tuberculosis program, which is worse than having no tuberculosis program because it would significantly increase the risk of the development of more widespread drug-resistant strains of the disease.\u201c(8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by the disease.\u201dProgress Report on Implementation of Immunization and Oral Rehydration Promotion ProgramsPub.

Development of indigenous energy resources(a) Congressional statement of findings(1)(A) The Congress finds that energy development and production are vital elements in the development process, that energy shortages in developing countries severely limit the development process in such countries, that two-thirds of the developing countries which import oil depend on it for at least 90 percent of the energy which their economies require, and that the dramatic increase in world oil prices since 1973 has resulted in considerable economic hardship for many developing countries. The Congress is concerned that the value and purpose of much of the assistance provided to developing countries under sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title are undermined by the inability of many developing countries to satisfy their energy requirements. Unless the energy deficit of the developing countries can be narrowed by more fully exploiting indigenous sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, and coal, scarce foreign exchange will increasingly have to be diverted to oil imports, primarily to the detriment of long-term development and economic growth.(B) The Congress recognizes that many developing countries lack access to the financial resources and technology necessary to locate, explore, and develop indigenous energy resources.(C) The Congress declares that there is potential for at least a moderate incr", "ease by 1990 in the production of energy for commercial use in the developing countries which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In addition, there is a compelling need for vigorous efforts to improve the available data on the location, scale, and commercial exploitability of potential oil, natural gas, and coal reserves in developing countries, especially those which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Congress further declares that there are many benefits to be gained by the developing countries and by the United States and other developed countries through expanded efforts to expedite the location, exploration, and development of potential sources of energy in developing countries. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:(i) The world\u2019s energy supply would be increased and the fear of abrupt depletion would be lessened with new energy production. This could have a positive impact upon energy prices in international markets as well as a positive effect upon the balance of payments problems of many developing countries.(ii) Diversification of the world\u2019s supplies of energy from fossil fuels would make all countries, developing and developed, less susceptible to supply interruptions and arbitrary production and pricing policies.(iii) Even a moderate increase in energy production in the developing countries would improve their ability to expand commercial trade, foreign investment, and technology transfer possibilities with the United States and other developed countries.(D) Assistance for the production of energy from indigenous resources, as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, would be of direct benefit to the poor in developing countries because of the overwhelming impact of imported energy costs upon the lives of the poor and their ability to participate in development.(2) The Congress also finds that energy production from renewable, decentralized sources and energy conservation are vital elements in the d", "evelopment process.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The American people abhor torture by any government or person. The existence of torture creates a climate of fear and international insecurity that affects all people.\u201c(2) Torture is the deliberate mental and physical damage caused by governments to individuals to destroy individual personality and terrorize society. The effects of torture are long term.

L. 109\u201395, \u00a7\u202f2Nov. 8, 2005119 Stat. 2111\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) As of July 2004, there were more than 143,000,000 children living in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean who were identified as orphans, having lost one or both of their parents. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children were identified as double orphans, having lost both parents\u2014the vast majority of whom died of AIDS. These children often are disadvantaged in numerous and devastating ways and most households with orphans cannot meet the basic needs of health care, food, clothing, and educational expenses.\u201c(2) It is estimated that 121,000,000 children worldwide do not attend school and that the majority of such children are young girls. According to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), orphans are less likely to be in school and more likely to be working full time.\u201c(3) School food programs, including", " take-home rations, in developing countries provide strong incentives for children to remain in school and continue their education. School food programs can reduce short-term hunger, improve cognitive functions, and enhance learning, behavior, and achievement.\u201c(4) Financial barriers, such as school fees and other costs of education, prevent many orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries from attending school. Providing children with free primary school education, while simultaneously ensuring that adequate resources exist for teacher training and infrastructure, would help more orphans and other vulnerable children obtain a quality education.\u201c(5) The trauma that results from the loss of a parent can trigger behavior problems of aggression or emotional withdrawal and negatively affect a child\u2019s performance in school and the child\u2019s social relations. Children living in families affected by HIV/AIDS or who have been orphaned by AIDS often face stigmatization and discrimination. Providing culturally appropriate psychosocial support to such children can assist them in successfully accepting and adjusting to their circumstances.\u201c(6) Orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries routinely are denied their inheritance or encounter difficulties in claiming the land and other property which they have inherited. Even when the inheritance rights of women and children are spelled out in law, such rights are difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many countries it is difficult or impossible for a widow, even if she has young children, to claim property after the death of her husband.\u201c(7) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating affect on children and is deepening poverty in entire communities and jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected areas.\u201c(8) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased the number of orphans worldwide and has exacerbated the poor living conditions of the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable children. AIDS has created an unprecedented o", "rphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. An estimated 14,000,000 orphans have lost 1 or both parents to AIDS. By 2010, it is estimated that over 25,000,000 children will have been orphaned by AIDS.\u201c(9) Approximately 2,500,000 children under the age of 15 worldwide have HIV/AIDS. Every day another 2,000 children under the age of 15 are infected with HIV. Without treatment, most children born with HIV can expect to die by age two, but with sustained drug treatment through childhood, the chances of long-term survival and a productive adulthood improve dramatically.\u201c(10) Few international development programs specifically target the treatment of children with HIV/AIDS in developing countries. Reasons for this include the perceived low priority of pediatric treatment, a lack of pediatric health care professionals, lack of expertise and experience in pediatric drug dosing and monitoring, the perceived complexity of pediatric treatment, and mistaken beliefs regarding the risks and benefits of pediatric treatment.\u201c(11) Although a number of organizations seek to meet the needs of orphans or other vulnerable children, extended families and local communities continue to be the primary providers of support for such children.\u201c(12) The HIV/AIDS pandemic is placing huge burdens on communities and is leaving many orphans with little support. Alternatives to traditional orphanages, such as community-based resource centers, continue to evolve in response to the massive number of orphans that has resulted from the pandemic.\u201c(13) The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for political stability, human welfare, and development that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide, and this crisis requires an accelerated response from the international community.\u201c(14) Although section 403(b) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(b)\u201c(15) Numerous United States and indigenous private", " voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. Many of these organizations have submitted applications for grants to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to provide increased levels of assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.\u201c(16) Increasing the amount of assistance that is provided by the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development through United States and indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, will provide greater protection for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.\u201c(17) It is essential that the United States Government adopt a comprehensive approach for the provision of assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. A comprehensive approach would ensure that important services, such as basic care, psychosocial support, school food programs, increased educational opportunities and employment training and related services, the protection and promotion of inheritance rights for such children, and the treatment of orphans and other vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS, are made more accessible.\u201c(18) Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children can best be provided by a comprehensive approach of the United States Government that\u2014\u201c(A) ensures that Federal agencies and the private sector coordinate efforts to prevent and eliminate duplication of efforts and waste in the provision of such assistance; and\u201c(B) to the maximum extent possible, focuses on community-based programs that allow orphans and other vulnerable children to remain connected to the traditions and rituals of their families and communities.\u201dStrategy of the United StatesPub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005\u2019.\u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Water-related diseases are a human tragedy, killing up to five million people annually, preventing millions of people from leading healthy lives, and undermining development efforts.\u201c(2) A child dies an average of every 15 seconds because of lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation.\u201c(3) In the poorest countries in the world, one out of five children dies from a preventable, water-related disease.\u201c(4) Lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices are directly responsible for the vast majority of diarrheal diseases which kill over two million children each year.\u201c(5) At any given time, half of all people in the developing world are suffering from one or more of the main diseases associated with inadequate provision of water supply and sanitation services.\u201c(6) Over 1.1 billion people, one in every six people in the world, lack access to safe drinking water.\u201c(7) Nearly 2.6 billion people, two in every five people in the world, lack access to basic sanitation services.\u201c(8) Half of all schools in the world do not have access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.\u201c(9) Over the past 20 years, two billion people have gained access to safe drinking water and 600 ", "million people have gained access to basic sanitation services.\u201c(10) Access to safe water and sanitation and improved hygiene are significant factors in controlling the spread of disease in the developing world and positively affecting worker productivity and economic development.\u201c(11) Increasing access to safe water and sanitation advances efforts toward other development objectives, such as fighting poverty and hunger, promoting primary education and gender equality, reducing child mortality, promoting environmental stability, improving the lives of slum dwellers, and strengthening national security.\u201c(12) Providing safe supplies of water and sanitation and hygiene improvements would save millions of lives by reducing the prevalence of water-borne diseases, water-based diseases, water-privation diseases, and water-related vector diseases.\u201c(13) Because women and girls in developing countries are often the carriers of water, lack of access to safe water and sanitation disproportionately affects women and limits women\u2019s opportunities at education, livelihood, and financial independence.\u201c(14) Between 20 percent and 50 percent of existing water systems in developing countries are not operating or are operating poorly.\u201c(15) In developing world water delivery systems, an average of 50 percent of all water is lost before it gets to the end-user.\u201c(16) Every $1 invested in safe water and sanitation would yield an economic return of between $3 and $34, depending on the region.\u201c(17) Developing sustainable financing mechanisms, such as pooling mechanisms and revolving funds, is necessary for the long-term viability of improved water and sanitation services.\u201c(18) The annual level of investment needed to meet the water and sanitation needs of developing countries far exceeds the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and spending by governments of developing countries, so facilitating and attracting greater public and private investment is essential.\u201c(19) Meeting the water and sanitation needs of the lowest-income dev", "eloping countries will require an increase in the resources available as grants from donor countries.\u201c(20) The long-term sustainability of improved water and sanitation services can be advanced by promoting community level action and engagement with civil society.\u201c(21) Target 10 of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals is to reduce by half the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015.\u201c(22) The participants in the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, including the United States, agreed to the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development which included an agreement to work to reduce by one-half \u2018the proportion of people who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water,\u2019 and \u2018the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation\u2019 by 2015.\u201c(23) At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the United States announced the Water for the Poor Initiative, committing $970 million for fiscal years 2003 through 2005 to improve sustainable management of fresh water resources and accelerate and expand international efforts to achieve the goal of cutting in half by 2015 the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water.\u201c(24) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 58/217 (February 9, 2004\u201c(25) Around the world, 263 river basins are shared by two or more countries, and many more basins and watersheds cross political or ethnic boundaries.\u201c(26) Water scarcity can contribute to insecurity and conflict on subnational, national, and international levels, thus endangering the national security of the United States.\u201c(27) Opportunities to manage water problems can be leveraged in ways to build confidence, trust, and peace between parties in conflict.\u201c(28) Cooperative water management can help resolve conflicts caused by other problems and is often a crucial component in resolving such conflicts.\u201c(29) Cooperative water management can help countries recover from conflict and", ", by promoting dialogue and cooperation among former parties in conflict, can help prevent the reemergence of conflict.\u201cSEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\u201cIt is the policy of the United States\u2014\u201c(1) to increase the percentage of water and sanitation assistance targeted toward countries designated as high priority countries under section 6(f) of this Act;\u201c(2) to ensure that water and sanitation assistance reflect an appropriate balance of grants, loans, contracts, investment insurance, loan guarantees, and other assistance to further ensure affordability and equity in the provision of access to safe water and sanitation for the very poor;\u201c(3) to ensure that the targeting of water and sanitation assistance reflect an appropriate balance between urban, periurban, and rural areas to meet the purposes of assistance described in section 135 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [this section], as added by section 5(a) of this Act;\u201c(4) to ensure that forms of water and sanitation assistance provided reflect the level of existing resources and markets for investment in water and sanitation within recipient countries;\u201c(5) to ensure that water and sanitation assistance, to the extent possible, supports the poverty reduction strategies of recipient countries and, when appropriate, encourages the inclusion of water and sanitation within such poverty reduction strategies;\u201c(6) to promote country and local ownership of safe water and sanitation programs, to the extent appropriate;\u201c(7) to promote community-based approaches in the provision of affordable and equitable access to safe water and sanitation, including the involvement of civil society;\u201c(8) to mobilize and leverage the financial and technical capacity of businesses, governments, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society in the form of public-private alliances;\u201c(9) to encourage reforms and increase the capacity of foreign governments to formulate and implement policies that expand access to safe water and sanitation in an affordable, equitable, and sustainable manner, i", "ncluding integrated strategic planning; and\u201c(10) to protect the supply and availability of safe water through sound environmental management, including preventing the destruction and degradation of ecosystems and watersheds.\u201cSEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\u201cIt is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) in order to make the most effective use of amounts of Official Development Assistance for water and sanitation and avoid waste and duplication, the United States should seek to establish innovative international coordination mechanisms based on best practices in other development sectors; and\u201c(2) the United States should greatly increase the amount of Official Development Assistance made available to carry out section 135 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [this section], as added by section 5(a) of this Act.\u201cSEC. 5.

Shelter for most people in the developing countries consists largely of domestic materials assembled by local labor. While recognizing that most financing for such shelter must come from domestic resources, the Congress finds that carefully designed programs involving United States capital and expertise can increase the availability of domestic financing for improved shelter and related services for low-income people by demonstrating to local entrepreneurs and institutions that providing low-cost shelter can be financially viable. The Congress reaffirms, therefore, that the United States should continue to assist developing countries in marshalling resources for low-cost shelter. Particular attention should be given to programs which ", "will support pilot projects for low-cost shelter or which will have a maximum demonstration impact on local institutions and national policy. The Congress declares that the long run goal of all such programs should be to develop domestic construction capabilities and to stimulate local credit institutions to make available domestic capital and other management and technological resources required for effective low-cost shelter programs and policies.(Pub.

Findings and policyCongress finds and declares the following:(1) Access to financial services and the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises are vital factors in the stable growth of developing countries, in the development of free, open, and equitable international economic systems, and in the economic empowerment of the poor, especially women.(2) It is therefore in the ", "best interest of the United States to facilitate access to financial services and assist the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, particularly enterprises owned, managed, and controlled by women.(3) Access to financial services and the development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises can be supported by programs providing credit, savings, training, technical assistance, business development services, and other financial services.(4) Given the relatively high percentage of populations living in rural areas of developing countries, and the combined high incidence of poverty in rural areas and growing income inequality between rural and urban markets, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise programs should target both rural and urban poor.(5) Microenterprise programs have been successful and should continue and be expanded to empower vulnerable women in the developing world. The Agency should work to ensure that recipients of development assistance for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises under this subpart communicate and work with nongovernmental organizations and government organizations to identify and assist victims of trafficking as provided for in section 7104(a)(1) of this title(6) Given that microenterprise programs have had some success in empowering disenfranchised groups such as women, development assistance for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises should also target populations disenfranchised due to race or ethnicity in countries where a strong relationship between poverty and race or ethnicity has been demonstrated.(Pub.

L. 106\u2013309, title I, \u00a7\u202f102Oct. 17, 2000114 Stat. 1079\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings and declarations:\u201c(1) According to the World Bank, more than 1,200,000,000 people in the developing world, or one-fifth of the world\u2019s population, subsist on less than $1 a day.\u201c(2) Over 3", "2,000 of their children die each day from largely preventable malnutrition and disease.\u201c(3)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads and less access to educational and economic opportunities than their male counterparts.\u201c(B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health and education, as women in particular reinvest income in their families.\u201c(4)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly women, generally lack stable employment and social safety nets.\u201c(B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial portion of their livelihood. In Africa, over 80 percent of employment is generated in the informal sector of the self-employed poor.\u201c(C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-employment activities.\u201c(D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.\u201c(5)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their businesses dramatically when they can access loans at reasonable interest rates.\u201c(B) Through the development of self-sustaining microfinance programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against hunger and poverty.\u201c(6)(A) On February 2\u20134, 1997, a global Microcredit Summit was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a plan to expand access to credit for self-employment and other financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world\u2019s poorest families, especially the women of those families, by 2005. While this scale of outreach may not be achievable in this short time-period, the realization of this goal could dramatically alter the face of global poverty.\u201c(B) With an average family size of five, achieving this goal will mean that the benefits of microfinance will thereby reach nearly half of the world\u2019s more than 1,000,000,000 absolute poor people.\u201c(7)(A) Nongove", "rnmental organizations, such as those that comprise the Microenterprise Coalition (such as the Grameen Bank (Bangladesh), K\u2013REP (Kenya), and networks such as Accion International, the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA), and the credit union movement) are successful in lending directly to the very poor.\u201c(B) Microfinance institutions such as BRAC (Bangladesh), BancoSol (Bolivia), SEWA Bank (India), and ACEP (Senegal) are regulated financial institutions that can raise funds directly from the local and international capital markets.\u201c(8)(A) Microenterprise institutions not only reduce poverty, but also reduce the dependency on foreign assistance.\u201c(B) Interest income on the credit portfolio is used to pay recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term sustainability of development assistance.\u201c(9) Microfinance institutions leverage foreign assistance resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits to program participants.\u201c(10)(A) The development of sustainable microfinance institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize domestic savings, is a critical component to a global strategy of poverty reduction and broad-based economic development.\u201c(B) In the efforts of the United States to lead the development of a new global financial architecture, microenterprise should play a vital role. The recent shocks to international financial markets demonstrate how the financial sector can shape the destiny of nations. Microfinance can serve as a powerful tool for building a more inclusive financial sector which serves the broad majority of the world\u2019s population including the very poor and women and thus generate more social stability and prosperity.\u201c(C) Over the last two decades, the United States has been a global leader in promoting the global microenterprise sector, primarily through its development assistance programs at the United States Agency for International Development. Additionally, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State have used their authority", " to promote microenterprise in the development programs of international financial institutions and the United Nations.\u201c(11)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International Development launched the \u2018Microenterprise Initiative\u2019 in partnership with the Congress.\u201c(B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, by the end of fiscal year 1996, one-half of all microenterprise resources would support programs and institutions that provide credit to the poorest, with loans under $300.\u201c(C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, increased investment in microfinance institutions serving the poorest will be critical.\u201c(12) Providing the United States share of the global investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit will require only a small increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with an increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.\u201c(13)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate successful microfinance institutions.\u201c(B) These institutions need assistance in developing their institutional capacity to expand their services and tap commercial sources of capital.\u201c(14) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated competence in developing networks of local microfinance institutions and other assistance delivery mechanisms so that they reach large numbers of the very poor, and achieve financial sustainability.\u201c(15) Recognizing that the United States Agency for International Development has developed very effective partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the Agency will have fewer missions overseas to carry out its work, the Agency should place priority on investing in those nongovernmental network institutions that meet performance criteria through the central funding mechanisms of the Agency.\u201c(16) By expanding and replicating successful microfinance institutions, it should be possible to create", " a global infrastructure to provide financial services to the world\u2019s poorest families.\u201c(17)(A) The United States can provide leadership to other bilateral and multilateral development agencies as such agencies expand their support to the microenterprise sector.\u201c(B) The United States should seek to improve coordination among G\u20137 countries in the support of the microenterprise sector in order to leverage the investment of the United States with that of other donor nations.\u201c(18) Through increased support for microenterprise, especially credit for the poorest, the United States can continue to play a leadership role in the global effort to expand financial services and opportunity to 100,000,000 of the poorest families on the planet.\u201dPurposes of 2000 AmendmentPub.

General provisions(a) Congressional objectives and findingsThe Congress declares that, in order to achieve the mutual goals among nations of ensuring food security, human health, agricultural growth, trade expansion, and the wise and sustainable use of natural resources, th", "e United States should mobilize the capacities of the United States land-grant universities, other eligible universities, and public and private partners of universities in the United States and other countries, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a\u20131 of this title, for: (1) global research on problems affecting food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; (2) improved human capacity and institutional resource development for the global application of agricultural and related environmental sciences; (3) agricultural development and trade research and extension services in the United States and other countries to support the entry of rural industries into world markets; and (4) providing for the application of agricultural sciences to solving food, health, nutrition, rural income, and environmental problems, especially such problems in low-income, food deficit countries.The Congress so declares because it finds\u2014(A) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress with and through the private sector in this country and to understanding processes of economic development;(B) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with international agencies, educational and research institutions in other countries, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations worldwide, in expanding global agricultural production, processing, business and trade, to the benefit of aid recipient countries and of the United States;(C) that, in a world of growing populations with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger and ensure human health and child survival, but to build the basis for economic growth and trade, and the social security in which democracy and a market economy can thrive, and moreover, that th", "e greatest potential for increasing world food supplies and incomes to purchase food is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current incomes are lowest;(D) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;(E) that, with expanding global markets and increasing imports into many countries, including the United States, food safety and quality, as well as secure supply, have emerged as mutual concerns of all countries;(F) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional and policy development therefore are prime factors in improving agricultural production, food distribution, processing, storage, and marketing abroad (as well as in the United States);(G) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture and the broader economy of the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all;(H) that there is a need to responsibly manage the world\u2019s agricultural and natural resources for sustained productivity, health and resilience to climate variability; and(I) that universities and public and private partners of universities need a dependable source of funding in order to increase the impact of their own investments and those of their State governments and constituencies, in order to continue and expand their efforts to advance agricultural development in cooperating countries, to translate development into economic growth and trade for the United States and cooperating countries, and to prepare future teachers, researchers, extension specialists, entrepreneurs, managers, and decisionmakers for the world economy.(b) Congressional declaration for collation of components to increase world food productionAccordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the following com", "ponents must be brought together in a coordinated program to increase world food and fiber production, agricultural trade, and responsible management of natural resources, including\u2014(1) continued efforts by the international agricultural research centers and other international research entities to provide a global network, including United States universities, for international scientific collaboration on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems of worldwide importance;(2) contract research and the implementation of collaborative research support programs and other research collaboration led by United States universities, and involving research systems in other countries focused on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems, with benefits to the United States and partner countries;(3) broadly disseminating the benefits of global agricultural research and development including increased benefits for United States agriculturally related industries through establishment of development and trade information and service centers, for rural as well as urban communities, through extension, cooperatively with, and supportive of, existing public and private trade and development related organizations;(4) facilitation of participation by universities and public and private partners of universities in programs of multilateral banks and agencies which receive United States funds;(5) expanding learning opportunities about global agriculture for students, teachers, community leaders, entrepreneurs, and the general public through international internships and exchanges, graduate assistantships, faculty positions, and other means of education and extension through long-term recurring Federal funds matched by State funds; and(6) competitive grants through universities to United States agriculturalists and public and private partners of universities from other countries for research, institution and policy development, extension, training, and other programs for globa", "l agricultural development, trade, and responsible management of natural resources.(c) University involvement, participation, and cooperationThe United States should\u2014(1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each of the program components described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b);(2) provide mechanisms for the universities and public and private partners of universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component;(3) assist such universities and public and private partners of universities in cooperative joint efforts with\u2014(A) agricultural institutions in developing nations;(B) regional and international agricultural research centers;(C) multilateral banks and agencies receiving United States funds;(D) development agencies of other countries; and(E) United States Government foreign assistance and economic cooperation programs;(4) generally engage the United States university community more extensively in the agricultural research, trade, and development initiatives undertaken outside the United States, with the objectives of strengthening its capacity to carry out research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, processing, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally developing nations, and for transforming progress in global agricultural research and development into economic growth, trade, and trade benefits for aid recipient countries and United States communities and industries, and for the wise use of natural resources;

Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or major illicit drug producing country set forth in sections 481(e)(2) and 481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (Public Law 87\u201319522 U.S.C. 2291(e)(2)The James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (Public Law 117\u2013263Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as having failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months", " to both adhere to their obligations under the international counternarcotics agreements and to take the measures required by section 489(a)(1) of the FAA [22 U.S.C. 2291h(a)(1)Although the rate of drug overdose deaths in the United States is flattening after years of sharp increases, more than 109,000 lives were lost to drug overdoses in 2022, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This remains unacceptably high, and my Administration is deploying unprecedented resources and building new partnerships to confront this public health and security crisis. Domestically, in the last fiscal year alone, the United States allocated more than $24 billion to expand evidence-based prevention and treatment, including harm reduction and recovery support services, with targeted investments to meet the needs of populations at greatest risk for overdose and substance use disorder. Beyond these additional resources, my Administration expanded access to Naloxone, which can reverse opioid-related overdoses, and made this life-saving medicine available over-the-counter. My Administration has also removed barriers to treatment, including by working with the Congress on bipartisan legislation. My Fiscal Year 2024 Budget calls for an even greater historic investment of $46.1 billion for National Drug Control Program agencies, a more than $2 billion increase from what was enacted during the previous year. This request also includes significant investments in reducing the supply of illicit drugs originating from beyond our borders.The vast majority of illicit drugs causing the most damage in the United States originate from beyond our borders, and our most effective means of reducing the availability of these drugs is to expand and improve our cooperation with international partners. Most drug overdose deaths within the United States involve illicit synthetic drugs and particularly synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. These synthetic drugs can be produced anywhere using precursor chemicals widel", "y available for legitimate purposes, at a fraction of the cost and time it takes criminal organizations to produce dangerous drugs from plants.Every country and region of the globe faces its own challenges from synthetic drugs. In Africa, the synthetic opioid tramadol is driving increasing numbers of injuries and fatalities, especially when mixed with other drugs. In the Middle East, synthetic stimulants are trafficked and sold as counterfeit captagon in large quantities. Ketamine\u2014a synthetic anesthetic with hallucinogenic effects\u2014is increasingly encountered throughout Asia, and it is being found mixed with methamphetamine, which appears to be growing more prevalent and more potent all over the world. And the categories of synthetic drugs are constantly shifting, as drug traffickers adjust formulas to avoid international controls and domestic regulations to create new demand. More than 1,100 new psychoactive substances and designer drugs have been detected and reported to the United Nations over the past decade alone.To confront this common challenge, the United States launched this past summer a new Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats. This diverse coalition of countries and international organizations will share best practices and expand cooperation to prevent the illicit manufacture and trafficking of synthetic drugs, detect emerging drug threats and use patterns, and promote public health interventions to prevent and reduce drug use and promote recovery. The United States welcomes all like-minded governments to participate in the work of this coalition and join efforts against these rapidly evolving global threats.The political commitment of our international partners remains critical to achieving success against illicit drug threats, and no country is more important than Mexico. Under the Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities, our two countries have cooperated to seize greater volumes of fentanyl and other drugs. We have worked successfully during the last ye", "ar to improve law enforcement collaboration, prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals, and arrest key organized crime figures involved in drugs and firearms trafficking, migrant smuggling, and other criminal activity. Sadly, some of these arrests resulted in the loss of lives of Mexican officials, and their sacrifices underscore the shared commitment from both countries to do what is necessary to fight these criminal organizations. To that end and to build on the increased cooperation of the past year, both countries should continue strengthening law enforcement information sharing and collaboration; build capacity to detect and counter drug production and trafficking and diversion of chemicals and drug-related equipment; and improve mechanisms to monitor, prevent, and treat drug substance use disorders.With our key partners in South America, the United States will continue to support ongoing efforts to reduce coca cultivation and cocaine production, expand access to justice, and promote alternative livelihoods. Colombia has historically been a strong partner in the fight against the drug trade. Nevertheless, illicit coca cultivation and cocaine production remain at historically high levels, and I urge the Government of Colombia to prioritize efforts to expand its presence in coca-producing regions and achieve sustainable progress against criminal organizations. In Bolivia, I encourage additional steps by the government to safeguard the country\u2019s licit coca markets from criminal exploitation, reduce illicit coca cultivation that continues to exceed legal limits under Bolivia\u2019s domestic laws for medical and traditional use, and continue to expand cooperation with international partners to disrupt transnational criminal networks.Afghanistan has been removed from the list of countries determined to have \u201cfailed demonstrably\u201d due to progress made within that country over the past year in reducing the cultivation of opium poppy and production of illicit narcotics. However, I remain concerned by the continuation of", " the illicit drug trade within and originating from Afghanistan, including methamphetamine. The country\u2019s drug control efforts must be sustained and expanded to include meaningful steps against drug trafficking and the drug supply chain, including by eliminating illicit drug stockpiles and curbing methamphetamine production. I will reconsider Afghanistan\u2019s status during the next annual review based on whether these additional steps are taken, in keeping with Afghanistan\u2019s international drug control commitments and in full respect for the human rights of its people.You are authorized and directed to submit this designation, with the Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela memoranda of justification, under section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and to publish this determination in the Federal Register.\nJ.R.

L. 107\u2013246, \u00a7\u202f2Oct. 23, 2002116 Stat. 1511\n\u201c(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Since the dissolution o", "f the Soviet Union, the leadership of the Russian Federation has publicly committed itself to building\u2014\u201c(A) a society with democratic political institutions and practices, the observance of universally recognized standards of human rights, and religious and press freedom; and\u201c(B) a market economy based on internationally accepted principles of transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.\u201c(2) In order to facilitate this transition, the international community has provided multilateral and bilateral technical assistance, and the United States\u2019 contribution to these efforts has played an important role in developing new institutions built on democratic and liberal economic foundations and the rule of law.\u201c(3)(A) Since 1992, United States Government democratic reform programs and public diplomacy programs, including training, and small grants have provided access to and training in the use of the Internet, brought nearly 40,000 Russian citizens to the United States, and have led to the establishment of more than 65,000 nongovernmental organizations, thousands of independent local media outlets, despite governmental opposition, and numerous political parties.\u201c(B) These efforts contributed to the substantially free and fair Russian parliamentary elections in 1995 and 1999.\u201c(4) The United States has assisted Russian efforts to replace its centrally planned, state-controlled economy with a market economy and helped create institutions and infrastructure for a market economy. Approximately two-thirds of the Russian Federation\u2019s gross domestic product is now generated by the private sector, and the United States recognized Russia as a market economy on June 7, 2002\u201c(5)(A) The United States has fostered grassroots entrepreneurship in the Russian Federation by focusing United States economic assistance on small- and medium-sized businesses and by providing training, consulting services, and small loans to more than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs.\u201c(B) There are now more than 900,000 small businesses in the Russian Federa", "tion, producing 12 to 15 percent, depending on the estimate, of the gross domestic product of the Russian Federation.\u201c(C) United States-funded programs have contributed to fighting corruption and financial crime, such as money laundering, by helping to\u2014\u201c(i) establish a commercial legal infrastructure;\u201c(ii) develop an independent judiciary;\u201c(iii) support the drafting of a new criminal code, civil code, and bankruptcy law;\u201c(iv) develop a legal and regulatory framework for the Russian Federation\u2019s equivalent of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission;\u201c(v) support Russian law schools;\u201c(vi) create legal aid clinics; and\u201c(vii) bolster law-related activities of nongovernmental organizations.\u201c(6) Because the capability of Russian democratic forces and the civil society to organize and defend democratic gains without international support is uncertain, and because the gradual integration of the Russian Federation into the global order of free-market, democratic nations would enhance Russian cooperation with the United States on a wide range of political, economic, and security issues, the success of democracy in Russia is in the national security interest of the United States, and the United States Government should develop a far-reaching and flexible strategy aimed at strengthening Russian society\u2019s support for democracy and a market economy, particularly by enhancing Russian democratic institutions and education, promoting the rule of law, and supporting Russia\u2019s independent media.\u201c(7) Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001\u201c(8) United States-Russia relations have improved, leading to a successful summit between President Bush and President Putin in May 2002, resulting in a \u2018Foundation for Cooperation\u2019.\u201c(b) PurposesThe purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendments note set out under section 2151 of this title\u201c(1) to strengthen and advance institutions of democratic government and of free and independent media, and to sustain the development of an independent civil society in the Russian Fed", "eration based on religious and ethnic tolerance, internationally recognized human rights, and an internationally recognized rule of law; and\u201c(2) to focus United States foreign assistance programs on using local expertise and to give local organizations a greater role in designing and implementing such programs, while maintaining appropriate oversight and monitoring.\u201dUnited States Policy Toward the Russian FederationPub.

Congressional statement of policy\nThe Congress of the United States reaffirms the policy of the United States to achieve international peace and security through the United Nations so that armed force shall not be used except for individual or collective self-defense. The Congress finds that the efforts of the United States and other friendly countries to promote peace and security continue to require measures of support based upon the principle of effective self-help and mutual aid. It is the purpose of subchapter II of this chapter to authorize measures in the common defense against internal and external aggression, including the furnishing of military assistance, upon request, to friendly countries and international organizations. In furnishing such military assistance, it remains the policy of the United States to continue to exert maximum efforts to achieve universal control of weapons of mass destruction and universal regulation and reduction of armaments, including armed forces, under adequate safeguards to protect complying countries against violation and evasion.The Congress recognizes that the peace of the world and the security of the United States are endangered so long as hostile countries continue by threat of military action, by the use of economic pressure, and by internal subversion, or other means to attempt to bring under their domination peoples now free and independent and continue to deny the rights of freedom and self-government to peoples and countries", " once free but now subject to such domination.It is the sense of the Congress that an important contribution toward peace would be made by the establishment under the Organization of American States of an international military force.In enacting this legislation, it is therefore the intention of the Congress to promote the peace of the world and the foreign policy, security, and general welfare of the United States by fostering an improved climate of political independence and individual liberty, improving the ability of friendly countries and international organizations to deter or, if necessary, defeat aggression, facilitating arrangements for individual and collective security, assisting friendly countries to maintain internal security, and creating an environment of security and stability in the developing friendly countries essential to their more rapid social, economic, and political progress. The Congress urges that all other countries able to contribute join in a common undertaking to meet the goals stated in subchapter II of this chapter.It is the sense of the Congress that in the administration of subchapter II of this chapter priority shall be given to the needs of those countries in danger of becoming victims of aggression or in which the internal security is threatened by internal subversion inspired or supported by hostile countries.Finally, the Congress reaffirms its full support of the progress of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization toward increased cooperation in political, military, and economic affairs. In particular, the Congress welcomes the steps which have been taken to promote multilateral programs of coordinated procurement, research, development, and production of defense articles and urges that such programs be expanded to the fullest extent possible to further the defense of the North Atlantic Area.(Pub.

Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) Economic development in conflict settings has been shown to support stabilization by empowering entrepreneurs, growing the middle class, and mitigating unemployment.\u201c(2) In 2018, unemployment in the Palestinian territories was 32.4 percent. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the Palestinian territories declined from 2017 to 2019, and it is projected to further decline in 2020.\u201c(3) According to the World Bank Ad Hoc Liaison Committee\u2019s April 2019 Economic Monitoring Report, \u2018to achieve sustainable economic growth, in the Palestinian territories, growth and job creation going forward will need to be private sector driven\u2019.\u201c(4) According to the 2018 Joint Strategic Plan of the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development, \u2018assistance can help prevent new recruitment to terrorist organizations, reduce levels of violence, promote legitimate governance structures that strengthen inclusion, and reduce policies that marginalize communities\u2019.\u201c(5) Although economic development is an important tool for stabilizing conflict-prone settings and establishing connections between communities, economic development by itself will not lead ", "to lasting peace. People-to-people peace-building programs further advance reconciliation efforts by promoting greater understanding, mutual trust, and cooperation between communities.\u201c(6) While the United States and its international partners continue to support diplomatic and political negotiations between the representatives of the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such efforts require broad popular support among the people on the ground to succeed.\u201c(7) Achieving sustainable, high-level agreements for lasting peace in the Middle East must come through, and with the support of, the people who live there, and the United States and its international partners can help the people of the region build popular support for sustainable agreements for lasting peace.\u201cSENSE OF CONGRESS\u201cSec. 8003. It is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) building a viable Palestinian economy is central to the effort to preserve the possibility of a negotiated settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution with the democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized, democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace, security, and mutual recognition;\u201c(2) United States and international support for grassroots, people-to-people efforts aimed at fostering tolerance, and building support for such solution, can help counter extremist propaganda and the growing issue of incitement;\u201c(3) strengthening engagement between Palestinians and Israelis, including through people-to-people peace-building programs can increase the bonds of friendship and understanding;\u201c(4) investing in the development of the Palestinian economy and in joint economic ventures can advance multiple sectors to the benefit of local, regional, and global parties; and\u201c(5) Congress encourages cooperation between Palestinian, American, and Israeli business sectors in order to benefit the Palestinian, American, and Israeli peoples and economies.\u201cPEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE FUND\u201cSec. 8004.

This title may be cited as the \u2018Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act of 2020\u2019. \u201cSec. 8002. Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) Economic development in conflict settings has been shown to support stabilization by empowering entrepreneurs, growing the middle class, and mitigating unemployment.\u201c(2) In 2018, unemployment in the Palestinian territories was 32.4 percent. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the Palestinian territories declined from 2017 to 2019, and it is projected to further decline in 2020.\u201c(3) According to the World Bank Ad Hoc Liaison Committee\u2019s April 2019 Economic Monitoring Report, \u2018to achieve sustainable economic growth, in the Palestinian territories, growth and job creation going forward will need to be private sector driven\u2019.\u201c(4) According to the 2018 Joint Strategic Plan of the Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development, \u2018assistance can help prevent new recruitment to terrorist organizations, reduce levels of violence, promote legitimate governance structures that strengthen inclusion, and reduce policies that marginalize communities\u2019.\u201c(5) Although economic development is an important tool for stabilizing conflict-prone settings and establishing connections between communities, economic development by itself will not lead to lasting peace. People-to-people peace-building programs further advance reconciliation efforts by promoting greater understanding, mutual trust, and cooperation between communities.\u201c(6) While the United States and its international partners continue to support diplomatic and political negotiations between the representatives of the parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such efforts require broad popular support among the people on the ground to succeed.\u201c(7) Achieving sustainable, high-level agreem", "ents for lasting peace in the Middle East must come through, and with the support of, the people who live there, and the United States and its international partners can help the people of the region build popular support for sustainable agreements for lasting peace. \u201cSec. 8003. It is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) building a viable Palestinian economy is central to the effort to preserve the possibility of a negotiated settlement leading to a sustainable two-state solution with the democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized, democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace, security, and mutual recognition;\u201c(2) United States and international support for grassroots, people-to-people efforts aimed at fostering tolerance, and building support for such solution, can help counter extremist propaganda and the growing issue of incitement;\u201c(3) strengthening engagement between Palestinians and Israelis, including through people-to-people peace-building programs can increase the bonds of friendship and understanding;\u201c(4) investing in the development of the Palestinian economy and in joint economic ventures can advance multiple sectors to the benefit of local, regional, and global parties; and\u201c(5) Congress encourages cooperation between Palestinian, American, and Israeli business sectors in order to benefit the Palestinian, American, and Israeli peoples and economies. \u201cSec. 8004.
