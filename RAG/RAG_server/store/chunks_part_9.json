Congressional findings and declaration of policy(a) Congress finds that\u2014(1) dairy products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet;(2) the production of dairy products plays a significant role in the Nation\u2019s economy, the milk from which dairy products are manufactured is produced by thousands of milk producers, and dairy products are consumed by millions of people throughout the United States;(3) dairy products must be readily available and marketed efficiently to en", "sure that the people of the United States receive adequate nourishment;(4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets for dairy products are vital to the welfare of milk producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and producing dairy products, as well as to the general economy of the Nation; and(5) dairy products move in interstate and foreign commerce, and dairy products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce of dairy products.(b) It, therefore, is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided herein, of an orderly procedure for financing (through assessments on all milk produced in the United States for commercial use and on imported dairy products) and carrying out a coordinated program of promotion designed to strengthen the dairy industry\u2019s position in the marketplace and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for fluid milk and dairy products.

Findings and purposes(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) Honey is produced by many individual producers in every State in the United States.(2) Honey and honey products move in large part in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce, and honey which does", " not move in such channels directly burdens or affects interstate commerce.(3) In recent years, large quantities of low-cost, imported honey have been brought into the United States, replacing domestic honey in the normal trade channels.(4) The maintenance and expansion of existing honey markets and the development of new or improved markets or uses are vital to the welfare of honey producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and processing honey, along with those engaged in general agricultural endeavors requiring bees for pollinating purposes.(5) The honey production industry within the United States is comprised mainly of small- and medium-sized businesses.(6) The development and implementation of coordinated programs of research, promotion, consumer education, and industry information necessary for the maintenance of markets and the development of new markets have been inadequate.(7) Without cooperative action in providing for and financing such programs, honey producers, honey handlers, wholesalers, and retailers are unable to implement programs of research, promotion, consumer education, and industry information necessary to maintain and improve markets for these products.(8) The ability to develop and maintain purity standards for honey and honey products is critical to maintaining the consumer confidence, safety, and trust that are essential components of any undertaking to maintain and develop markets for honey and honey products.(9) Research directed at improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of beekeeping, as well as developing better means of dealing with pest and disease problems, is essential to keeping honey and honey product prices competitive and facilitating market growth as well as maintaining the financial well-being of the honey industry.(10) Research involving the quality, safety, and image of honey and honey products and how that quality, safety, and image may be affected during the extraction, processing, packaging, marketing, and other stages of the honey and honey produc", "t production and distribution process, is highly important to building and maintaining markets for honey and honey products.(b) PurposesThe purposes of this chapter are\u2014(1) to authorize the establishment of an orderly procedure for the development and financing, through an adequate assessment, of an effective, continuous, and nationally coordinated program of promotion, research, consumer education, and industry information designed to\u2014(A) strengthen the position of the honey industry in the marketplace;(B) maintain, develop, and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for honey and honey products;(C) maintain and improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the honey industry; and(D) sponsor research to develop better means of dealing with pest and disease problems;(2) to maintain and expand the markets for all honey and honey products in a manner that\u2014(A) is not designed to maintain or expand any individual producer\u2019s, importer\u2019s, or handler\u2019s share of the market; and(B) does not compete with or replace individual advertising or promotion efforts designed to promote individual brand name or trade name honey or honey products; and(3) to authorize and fund programs that result in government speech promoting government objectives.(c) AdministrationNothing in this chapter\u2014(1) prohibits the sale of various grades of honey;(2) provides for control of honey production;(3) limits the right of the individual honey producer to produce honey; or(4) creates a trade barrier to honey or honey products produced in a foreign country.(Pub.

FindingsCongress finds that\u2014(1) United States agricultural exports have declined by more than 36 percent since 1981, from $43,800,000,000 in 1981 to $27,900,000,000 in 1987;(2) the United States share of the world market for agricultural commodities and products has dropped by 20 percent during the last 6 years;(3) for the first time in 15 years, the United States incurred monthly agricultural trade deficits in 1986;(4) the loss of $1,000,000,000 in United States agricultural exports causes the loss of 35,000 agricultural jobs and the loss of 60,000 nonagricultural jobs;(5) the loss of agricultural exports threatens family farms and the economic well-being of rural communities in the United States;(6) factors contributing to the loss of United States agricultural exports include changes in world agricultural markets such as\u2014(A) the addition of new exporting nations;(B) innovations in agricultural technology;(C) increased use of export subsidies designed to lower the price of commodities on the world market;(D) the existence of barriers to agricultural trade;(E) the slowdown in the growth of wo", "rld food demand in the 1980\u2019s due to cyclical economic factors, including currency fluctuations and a debt-related slowdown in the economic growth of agricultural markets in certain developing countries; and(F) the rapid buildup of surplus stocks as a consequence of favorable weather for agricultural production during the 1980\u2019s;(7) increasing the volume and value of exports is important to the financial well-being of the farm sector in the United States and to increasing farm income in the United States;(8) in order to increase agricultural exports and improve prices for farmers and ranchers in the United States, it is necessary that all agricultural export programs of the United States be used in an expeditious manner, including programs established under the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 169115 U.S.C. 7147 U.S.C. 1431(9) greater use should be made by the Secretary of Agriculture of the authorities established under section 4\u202f117 U.S.C. 1707a7 U.S.C. 16917 U.S.C. 143115 U.S.C. 714(A) improve the handling, marketing, processing, storage, and distribution of imported agricultural commodities and products; and(B) increase livestock production to enhance the demand for United States feed grains;(10) food aid and export assistance programs in developing countries stimulate economic activity which causes incomes to rise, and, as incomes rise, diets improve and the demand for and ability to purchase food increases;(11) private voluntary organizations and cooperatives are important and successful partners in our food aid and development programs; and(12) in addition to meeting humanitarian needs, food aid used in sales and barter programs by private voluntary organizations and cooperatives\u2014(A) provides communities with health care, credit systems, and tools for development; and(B) establishes the infrastructure that is essential to the expansion of markets for United States agricultural commodities and products.(Pub.

Honey bee pollination alone adds more than $15 billion in value to agricultural crops each year in the United States. Over the past few decades, there has been a significant loss of pollinators, including honey bees, native bees, birds, bats, and butterflies, from the environment. The problem is serious and requires immediate attention to ensure the sustainability of our food production systems, avoid additional economic impact on the agricultural sector, and protect the health of the environment.Pollinator losses have been severe. The number of migrating Monarch butterflies sank to the lowest recorded population level in 2013\u201314, and there is an imminent risk of failed migration. The continued loss of commercial honey bee colonies poses a threat to the economic stability of commercial beekeeping and pollination operations in the United States, which could have profound implications for agriculture and food. Severe yearly declines create concern that bee colony losses could reach a point from which the commercial pollination industry would not", " be able to adequately recover. The loss of native bees, which also play a key role in pollination of crops, is much less studied, but many native bee species are believed to be in decline. Scientists believe that bee losses are likely caused by a combination of stressors, including poor bee nutrition, loss of forage lands, parasites, pathogens, lack of genetic diversity, and exposure to pesticides.Given the breadth, severity, and persistence of pollinator losses, it is critical to expand Federal efforts and take new steps to reverse pollinator losses and help restore populations to healthy levels. These steps should include the development of new public-private partnerships and increased citizen engagement. Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:SectionEstablishing the Pollinator Health Task Force(a) the Department of State;(b) the Department of Defense;(c) the Department of the Interior;(d) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;(e) the Department of Transportation;(f) the Department of Energy;(g) the Department of Education;(h) the Council on Environmental Quality;(i) the Domestic Policy Council;(j) the General Services Administration;(k) the National Science Foundation;(l) the National Security Council Staff;(m) the Office of Management and Budget;(n) the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and(o) such executive departments, agencies, and offices as the Co-Chairs may designate.SecMission and Function of the Task Force(a) Pollinator Research Action Plan(i) studies of the health of managed honey bees and native bees, including longitudinal studies, to determine the relative contributions of, and mitigation strategies for, different stressors leading to species declines and colony collapse disorder, including exposure to pesticides, poor nutrition, parasites and other pests, toxins, loss of habitat and reduced natural forage, pathogens, and unsustainable management practices;(ii) plans for", " expanded collection and sharing of data related to pollinator losses, technologies for continuous monitoring of honey bee hive health, and use of public-private partnerships, as appropriate, to provide information on the status and trends of managed hive losses;(iii) assessments of the status of native pollinators, including the Monarch butterfly and bees, and modeling of native pollinator populations and habitats;(iv) strategies for developing affordable seed mixes, including native pollinator-friendly plants, for maintenance of honey bees and other pollinators, and guidelines for and evaluations of the effectiveness of using pollinator-friendly seed mixes for restoration and reclamation projects;(v) identification of existing and new methods and best practices to reduce pollinator exposure to pesticides, and new cost-effective ways to control bee pests and diseases; and(vi) strategies for targeting resources toward areas of high risk and restoration potential and prioritizing plans for restoration of pollinator habitat, based on those areas that will yield the greatest expected net benefits.(b) Public Education Plan(c) Public-Private Partnerships(d) Task Force member agencies shall report regularly to the Task Force on their efforts to implement section 3 of this memorandum.SecIncreasing and Improving Pollinator Habitat(a) Task Force member agencies shall develop and provide to the Task Force plans to enhance pollinator habitat, and subsequently implement, as appropriate, such plans on their managed lands and facilities, consistent with their missions and public safety.

or(19) any other provision of law enacted after April 4, 1996(b) FindingsCongress finds the following:(1) It is in the national public interest and vital to the welfare of the agricultural economy of the United States to maintain and expand existing markets and develop new markets and uses for agricultural commodities through industry-funded, Government-supervised, generic commodity promotion programs established under commodity promotion laws.(2) These generic commodity promotion programs, funded by the agricultural producers or processors who most directly reap the benefits of the programs and supervised by the Secretary of Agriculture, provide a unique opportunity for producers and processors to inform consumers about their products.(3) The central congressional purpose underlying each commodity promotion law has always been to maintain and expand markets for the agricultural commodity covered by the law, rather than to maintain or expand the share of those markets held by any individual producer or processor.(4) The commodity promotion laws were neither designed nor intended to prohibit or restrict, and the promotion programs established and funded pursuant to these laws do not prohibit or restrict, individual advertising or promotion of the covered commodities by any producer, processor, or group of producers or processors.(5) It has never been the intent of Congress for the generic commodity promotion programs established and funded by the commodity promotion laws to replace the individual advertising and promotion efforts of producers or processors.(6) An individual producer\u2019s or processor\u2019", "s own advertising initiatives are typically designed to increase the share of the market held by that producer or processor rather than to increase or expand the overall size of the market.(7) In contrast, a generic commodity promotion program is intended and designed to maintain or increase the overall demand for the agricultural commodity covered by the program and increase the size of the market for that commodity, often by utilizing promotion methods and techniques that individual producers and processors typically are unable, or have no incentive, to employ.(8) The commodity promotion laws establish promotion programs that operate as \u201cself-help\u201d mechanisms for producers and processors to fund generic promotions for covered commodities which, under the required supervision and oversight of the Secretary of Agriculture\u2014(A) further specific national governmental goals, as established by Congress; and(B) produce nonideological and commercial communication the purpose of which is to further the governmental policy and objective of maintaining and expanding the markets for the covered commodities.(9) While some commodity promotion laws grant a producer or processor the option of crediting individual advertising conducted by the producer or processor for all or a portion of the producer\u2019s or processor\u2019s marketing promotion assessments, all promotion programs established under the commodity promotion laws, both those programs that permit credit for individual advertising and those programs that do not contain such provisions, are very narrowly tailored to fulfill the congressional purposes of the commodity promotion laws without impairing or infringing the legal or constitutional rights of any individual producer or processor.(10) These generic commodity promotion programs are of particular benefit to small producers who often lack the resources or market power to advertise on their own and who are otherwise often unable to benefit from the economies of scale available in promotion and advertising.(11) Periodic inde", "pendent evaluation of the effectiveness of these generic commodity promotion programs will assist Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture in ensuring that the objectives of the programs are met.(c) Independent evaluation of promotion program effectivenessExcept as otherwise provided by law, each commodity board established under the supervision and oversight of the Secretary of Agriculture pursuant to a commodity promotion law shall, not less often than every 5 years, authorize and fund, from funds otherwise available to the board, an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the generic commodity promotion programs and other programs conducted by the board pursuant to a commodity promotion law. The board shall submit to the Secretary, and make available to the public, the results of each periodic independent evaluation conducted under this subsection.(d) Administrative costsThe Secretary shall annually provide to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate information on administrative expenses on programs established under commodity promotion laws.(e) Exemption of certified organic products from promotion order assessments(1) In generalNotwithstanding any provision of a commodity promotion law, a person that produces, handles, markets, or imports organic products may be exempt from the payment of an assessment under a commodity promotion law with respect to any agricultural commodity that is certified as \u201corganic\u201d or \u201c100 percent organic\u201d (as defined in part 205 of title 7, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation)).(2) Split operationsThe exemption described in paragraph (1) shall apply to the certified \u201corganic\u201d or \u201c100 percent organic\u201d (as defined in part 205 of title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation)) products of a producer, handler, or marketer regardless of whether the agricultural commodity subject to the exemption is produced, handled, or marketed by a person that ", "also produces, handles, or markets conventional or nonorganic agricultural products, including conventional or nonorganic agricultural products of the same agricultural commodity as that for which the exemption is claimed.(3) ApprovalThe Secretary shall approve the exemption of a person under this subsection if the person maintains a valid organic certificate issued under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6501(4) Termination of effectivenessThis subsection shall be effective until the date on which the Secretary issues an organic commodity promotion order in accordance with subsection (f).(5) RegulationsThe Secretary shall promulgate regulations concerning eligibility and compliance for an exemption under paragraph (1).(f) Organic commodity promotion order(1) DefinitionsIn this subsection:(A) Certified organic farmThe term \u201ccertified organic farm\u201d has the meaning given the term in section 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6502(B) Covered personThe term \u201ccovered person\u201d means a producer, handler, marketer, or importer of an organic agricultural commodity.(C) Dual-covered agricultural commodityThe term \u201cdual-covered agricultural commodity\u201d means an agricultural commodity that\u2014(i) is produced on a certified organic farm; and(ii) is covered under both\u2014(I) an organic commodity promotion order issued pursuant to paragraph (2); and(II) any other agricultural commodity promotion order issued under a commodity promotion law.(2) AuthorizationThe Secretary may issue an organic commodity promotion order under section 7413 of this title(A) is produced or handled (as defined in section 2103 of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6502(B) is imported with a valid organic certificate (as defined in that part).(3) ElectionIf the Secretary issues an organic commodity promotion order described in paragraph (2), a covered person may elect, for applicable dual-covered agricultural commodities and in the sole discretion of the covered person, whether to be assessed under the orga", "nic commodity promotion order or another applicable agricultural commodity promotion order.(4) RegulationsThe Secretary shall promulgate regulations concerning eligibility and compliance for an exemption under paragraph (1).(Pub.

Findings and purpose(a) FindingsCongress finds the following:(1) The production of agricultural commodities plays a significant role in the economy of the United States. Thousands of producers in the United States are involved in the production of agricultural commodities, and such commodities are consumed by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign countries.(2) Agricultural commodities must be of high quality, readily available, handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that consumers have an adequate supply.(3) The maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the development of new markets for agricultural commodities through generic commodity promotion, research, and information programs are vital to the welfare of persons engaged in the production, marketing, and consumption of such commodities, as well as to the general economy of the United States.(4) Generic promotion, research, and information activities for agricultural commodities play a unique role in advancing the demand for such commodities, since such activities increase the total market for a product to the benefit of consumers and all producers. These generic activities complement branded advertising initiatives, which are aimed at increasing the market share of individual competitors, and are of particular benefit to small producers who lack the resources or market power to advertise on their own. These generic activities do not impede the branded advertising efforts of individual firms, but instead increase general market demand for an agricultural commodity using methods that individual companies do not have the incentive to employ.(5) Generic promotion, research, and information activities for agricultur", "al commodities, paid by the producers and others in the industry who reap the benefits of such activities, provide a unique opportunity for producers to inform consumers about a particular agricultural commodity.(6) It is important to ensure that generic promotion, research, and information activities for agricultural commodities be carried out in an effective and coordinated manner designed to strengthen the position of the commodities in the marketplace and to maintain and expand their markets and uses. Independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the generic promotion activities of these programs will assist the Secretary of Agriculture and Congress in ensuring that these objectives are met.(7) The cooperative development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated national program of research, promotion, and information regarding agricultural commodities are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets and to develop new markets for these commodities.(8) Agricultural commodities move in interstate and foreign commerce, and agricultural commodities and their products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce in agricultural commodities and their products.(9) Commodity promotion programs have the ability to provide significant conservation benefits to producers and the public.(b) PurposeThe purpose of this subchapter is to authorize the establishment, through the exercise by the Secretary of Agriculture of the authority provided in this subchapter, of an orderly program for developing, financing, and carrying out an effective, continuous, and coordinated program of generic promotion, research, and information regarding agricultural commodities designed to\u2014(1) strengthen the position of agricultural commodity industries in the marketplace;(2) maintain and expand existing domestic and foreign markets and uses for agricultural commodities;(3) develop new markets and uses for agricultural commodities; or(4) assist producers in meeting their conservation o", "bjectives.(c) Rule of constructionNothing in this subchapter provides for the control of production or otherwise limits the right of any person to produce, handle, or import an agricultural commodity.(Pub.

While producing c", "lean renewable fuels locally is a powerful engine of economic growth, they must be developed and used in a way that limits environmental impact. Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, to set new national renewable fuel standards and implement those standards. The public will have an opportunity to provide input on this proposal through a 60-day comment period, and the EPA is conducting peer reviews on key aspects of the environmental impact assessments within the proposal.In order to shepherd our Nation\u2019s development of this important industry and to coordinate interagency policy, I hereby establish a Biofuels Interagency Working Group (Working Group), to be co-chaired by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy and the Administrator of the EPA. This Working Group will coordinate with the National Science and Technology Council\u2019s Biomass Research and Development Board in undertaking its work. The responsibilities of the Working Group shall include:(a) Developing the Nation\u2019s first comprehensive biofuel market development program, which shall use existing authorities and identify new policies to support the development of next-generation biofuels, increase flexible fuel vehicle use, and assist in retail marketing efforts;(b) Coordinating infrastructure policies affecting the supply, secure transport, and distribution of biofuels; and(c) Identifying new policy options to promote the environmental sustainability of biofuels feedstock production, taking into consideration land use, habitat conservation, crop management practices, water efficiency and water quality, as well as lifecycle assessments of greenhouse gas emissions.Alongside the Working Group\u2019s efforts, the Secretary of Agriculture may pursue other important biofuel development efforts. The Rural Development Act of 1972 and the Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 direct the Secretary of Agriculture to develop, in coordination with State a", "nd local governments, a nationwide rural development program to assure rural America\u2019s health and prosperity. In keeping with that mandate, and recognizing the key role rural America will play in the development of biofuel technology and development, I request that the Secretary of Agriculture take the following steps, to the extent permitted by law:(a) Immediately begin restructuring existing investments in renewable fuels as needed to preserve industry employment; and(b) Develop a comprehensive approach to accelerating the investment in and production of American biofuels and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels by providing, within 30 days, under the authorities made available in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008:(i) Loan guarantees for the development, construction, and retrofitting of commercial-scale biorefineries and grants to help pay for the development and construction costs of demonstration-scale biorefineries;(ii) Expedited funding to encourage biorefineries to replace the use of fossil fuels in plant operations by installing new biomass energy systems or producing new energy from renewable biomass;(iii) Expedited funding to biofuels producers to encourage production of next-generation biofuels from cellulosic biomass and other feedstocks;(iv) Expansion of the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program, which has been renamed the Rural Energy for America Program, to include hydroelectric source technologies, energy audits, and higher loan guarantee limits; and (v) Guidance and support for collection, harvest, storage, and transportation assistance for eligible materials for use in biomass conversion facilities.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Secretary of Agriculture is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memo", "randum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f8102.

It is one of the key elements in my efforts to promote sustainable acquisition throughout the Government under [former] Executive Order 13514 of October 5, 2009The goal of this memorandum is to ensure that executive departments and agencies (agencies) effectively execute Federal procurement requirements for biobased products, including those requirements identified in [former] Executive Order 13514 and prescribed in the 2002 Farm Bill, as amended by the 2008 Farm Bill. It is vital that these efforts are in accord and carefully coordinated with other Federal procurement requirements.Therefore, I direct that agencies take the following steps to significantly increase Federal procurement of biobased and other sustainable products.SectionMar. 19, 2015SecBiobased Product Designations(a) increase both the number of categories of biobased products designated and individual products eligible for preferred purchasing by 50 percent within 1 year of the date of this memorandum; and(b) establish a web-based process whereby biobased product manufacturers can request USDA to establish a new product category for designation. The USDA shall determine the merit of the request and, if the product category is deemed eligible, propose designation within 180 days of the request.SecChanges in Procurement Mechanisms(a) the Senior Sustainability Officers and Chief Acquisition Officers of all agencies to randomly sample procurement actions (such as solicitations and awards) to verify that biobased considerations are included as appropriate. Agencies shall include results of", " these sampling efforts in the Sustainability/Energy scorecard reported to OMB;(b) the Secretary of Agriculture to work with relevant officials in agencies that have electronic product procurement catalogs to identify and implement solutions to increase the visibility of biobased and other sustainable products;(c) the Senior Sustainability Officers of all agencies that have established agency-specific product specifications, in coordination with any other appropriate officials, to review and revise all specifications under their control to assure that, wherever possible and appropriate, such specifications require the use of sustainable products, including USDA-designated biobased products, and that any language prohibiting the use of biobased products is removed.
