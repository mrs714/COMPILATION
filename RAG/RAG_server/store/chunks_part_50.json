Assistance to Pakistan(a) Congressional policy, findings, and goalsThe Congress recognizes that Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan pose a security threat to Pakistan. The Congress also recognizes that an independent and democratic Pakistan with continued friendly ties with the United", " States is in the interest of both nations. The Congress finds that United States assistance will help Pakistan maintain its independence. Assistance to Pakistan is intended to benefit the people of Pakistan by helping them meet the burdens imposed by the presence of Soviet forces in Afghanistan and by promoting economic development. In authorizing assistance to Pakistan, it is the intent of Congress to promote the expeditious restoration of full civil liberties and representative government in Pakistan. The Congress further recognizes that it is in the mutual interest of Pakistan and the United States to avoid the profoundly destabilizing effects of the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices or the capacity to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear devices.(b) Reaffirmation of 1959 bilateral agreementThe United States reaffirms the commitment made in its 1959 bilateral agreement with Pakistan relating to aggression from a Communist or Communist-dominated state.(c) Availability; defensive aspects of assistanceSecurity assistance for Pakistan shall be made available in order to assist Pakistan in dealing with the threat to its security posed by the Soviet presence in Afghanistan.

Nuclear non-proliferation policy in South Asia(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remains one of the most serious threats to international peace and stability;(2) South Asia, in particular, is an area where the threat of a regional nuclear exchange remains high due to continued Indo-Pakistani tensions over issues such as Kashmir;(3) to date, United States efforts to halt proliferation in South Asia have failed;(4) although global disarmament is a desirable goal which should be vigorously pursued, both regional and sub-regional security arrangements can serve to decrease tensions and promote non-proliferation in certain areas;(5) thus far, there has been some success on a regional basis, such as the South Pacific Nuclear Weapons Free Zone and the Treaty of Tlatelolco in Latin America;(6) in particular, in Latin America, the Treaty of Tlatelolco has been signed by all the nuclear powers;(7) a critical part of this treaty is Protocol II which prohibits nuclear attacks by nucl", "ear weapons states on signatories to the treaty;(8) in 1991, a proposal was made for a regional conference on non-proliferation in South Asia which would include Pakistan, India, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States; and(9) thus far, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States have expressed interest in attending such a conference, whereas India has refused to attend.(b) PolicyIt is the sense of the Congress that the President should pursue a policy which seeks a regional negotiated solution to the issue of nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia at the earliest possible time, including a protocol to be signed by all nuclear weapons states, prohibiting nuclear attacks by nuclear weapons states on countries in the region. Such a policy should have as its ultimate goal concurrent accession by Pakistan and India to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and should also include as needed a phased approach to that goal through a series of agreements among the parties on nuclear issues, such as the agreement reached by Pakistan and India not to attack one another\u2019s nuclear facilities.(Pub.

Findings and purposes(a) FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) It is the established policy of the United States to support and seek protection of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems around the world.(2) Tropical forests provide a wide range of benefits to humankind by\u2014(A) harboring a major share of the Earth\u2019s biological and terrestrial resources, which are the basis for developing pharmaceutical products and revitalizing agricultural crops;(B) playing a critical role as carbon sinks in reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thus moderating potential global climate change; and(C) regulating hydrological cycles on which agricultural and coastal resources depend.(3) International negotiations and assistance programs to conserve forest resources have proliferated over the past decade, but the rapid rate of tropical deforestation continues unabated.(4) Developing countries with urgent needs for investment and capital for development have allocated a significant amount of their forests to logging concessions.(5) Poverty and economic pressures on the populations of developing countries have, over time, resulted in clearing ", "of vast areas of forest for conversion to agriculture, which is often unsustainable in the poor soils underlying tropical forests.(6) Debt reduction can reduce economic pressures on developing countries and result in increased protection for tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems.(7) Finding economic benefits to local communities from sustainable uses of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems is critical to the protection of such areas.(b) PurposesThe purposes of this subchapter are\u2014(1) to recognize the values received by United States citizens from protection of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems;(2) to facilitate greater protection of tropical forests and coral ecosystems (and to give priority to protecting areas with the highest levels of biodiversity and under the most severe threat) by providing for the alleviation of debt in countries where tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems are located, thus allowing the use of additional resources to protect these critical resources and reduce economic pressures that have led to deforestation;(3) to ensure that resources freed from debt in such countries are targeted to protection of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems and their associated values; and(4) to rechannel existing resources to facilitate the protection of tropical forests and coral reef ecosystems.(Pub.

These negotiations include negotiations for (A) reductions in strategic forces, conventional armaments, and military personnel levels, (B) regimes for monitoring nuclear testing, and (C) the complete elimination of chemical weapons.\u201c(2) Requirements for monitoring these possible treaties or agreements will be extensive and will place severe stress on the monitoring capabilities of United States national technical means.\u201c(3) In the case of the INF Treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union negotiated, and are currently using, on-site inspection procedures to complement and support monitoring by national technical means. Similar on-site inspection procedures are being negotiated for inclusion in possible future treaties and agreements referred to in paragraph (1).\u201c(4) During initial implementation of the provisions of the INF Treaty, the United States was not fully prepared for the personnel requirements for the conduct of on-site inspections. The Director of Central Intelligence has stated that on-site inspection requirements for any strategic arms reduction treaty or agreement will be far more extensive than those for the INF Treaty. The number of locations within the Soviet Union that would p", "ossibly be subject to on-site inspections under a START agreement have been estimated to be approximately 2,500 (compared to 120 for the INF Treaty).\u201c(5) On-site inspection procedures are likely to be an integral part of any future arms control treaty or agreement.\u201c(6) Personnel requirements will be extensive for such on-site inspection procedures, both in terms of numbers of personnel and technical and linguistic skills. Since verification requirements for the INF Treaty are already placing severe stress on current personnel resources, the requirements for verification under START and other possible future treaties and agreements may quickly exceed the current number of verification personnel having necessary technical and language skills.\u201c(7) There is a clear need for a database of the names of individuals who are members of the Armed Forces or civilian employees of the United States Government, or of other citizens and nationals of the United States, who are qualified (by reason of technical or language skills) to participate in on-site inspections under an arms control treaty or agreement.\u201c(8) The organization best suited to establish such a database is the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA) of the Department of Defense, which was created by the President to implement (for the United States) the on-site inspection provisions of the INF Treaty.\u201c(b) Status of the OSIA(1) Congress finds that\u2014\u201c(A) the Director of the OSIA (currently a brigadier general of the Army) is appointed by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the approval of the President;\u201c(B) the Secretary of Defense provides to the Director appropriate policy guidance formulated by the interagency arms control mechanism established by the President;\u201c(C) most of the personnel of the OSIA are members of the Armed Forces (who are trained and paid by the military departments within the Department of Defense) and include linguists, weapons specialists, and foreign area specialists;\u201c(D) the Department of Defense provides t", "he OSIA with substantially all of its administrative and logistic support (including military air transportation for inspections in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe); and\u201c(E) the facilities in Europe and the United States at which OSIA personnel escort personnel of the Soviet Union conducting inspections under the on-site inspection terms of the INF Treaty are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense (or under the jurisdiction of entities that are contractors with the Department of Defense).\u201c(2) In light of the findings in paragraph (1) and the report submitted pursuant to section 909 of Public Law 100\u2013456Sept. 29, 1988102 Stat. 2036July 27, 1989\u201c(c) Establishment of Personnel Database(1) In light of the findings in subsection (a), the Director of the On-Site Inspection Agency shall establish a database consisting of the names of individuals who could be assigned or detailed (in the case of Government personnel) or employed (in the case of non-Government personnel) to participate in the conduct of on-site inspections under any future arms control treaty or agreement that includes provisions for such inspections.\u201c(2) The database should be composed of the names of individuals with skills (including linguistic and technical skills) necessary for the conduct of on-site inspections.\u201c(d) INF Treaty DefinedFor purposes of this section, the term \u2018INF Treaty\u2019 means the Treaty Between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed in Washington, DC, on December 8, 1987 \u00a7\u202f2595a.

The Protocols have been used throughout the last century by despots such as Adolf Hitler to justify violence against Jews.\u201c(5) In November 2003, Arab television featured an anti-Semitic series, entitled \u2018Ash-Shatat\u2019 (or \u2018The Diaspora\u2019), which depicts Jewish people hatching a plot for Jewish control of the world.\u201c(6) The sharp rise in anti-Semitic violence has caused international organizations such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to elevate, and bring renewed focus to, the issue, including the convening by the OSCE in June 2003 of a conference in Vienna dedicated solely to the issue of anti-Semitism.\u201c(7) The OSCE convened a conference again on April 28\u201329, 2004, in Berlin, to address the problem of anti-Semitism with the United States delegation led by former Mayor of New York City, Ed Koch.\u201c(8) The United States Government has strongly supported efforts to address anti-Semitism th", "rough bilateral relationships and interaction with international organizations such as the OSCE, the European Union, and the United Nations.\u201c(9) Congress has consistently supported efforts to address the rise in anti-Semitic violence. During the 107th Congress, both the Senate and the House of Representatives passed resolutions expressing strong concern with the sharp escalation of anti-Semitic violence in Europe and calling on the Department of State to thoroughly document the phenomenon.\u201c(10) Anti-Semitism has at times taken the form of vilification of Zionism, the Jewish national movement, and incitement against Israel.\u201d \u00a7\u202f2732.

Need for international defense cooperation and military export controls; Presidential waiver; report to Congress; arms sales policy\nAs declared by the Congress in the Arms Control and Disarmament Act [22 U.S.C. 2551The Congress recognizes, however, that the United States and other free and independent countries continue to have valid requirements for effective and mutually beneficial defense relationships in order to maintain and foster the environment of international peace and security essential to social, economic, and political progress. Because of the growing cost and complexity of defense equipment, it is increasingly difficult and uneconomic for any country, particularly a developing country, to fill all of its legitimate defense requirements from its own design and production base. The need for international defense cooperation among the United States and those friendly countries to which it is allied by mutual defense treaties is especially important, since the effectiveness of their armed forces to act in concert to deter or defeat aggression is directly related to the operational compatibility of their defense equipment.Accordingly, it remains the policy of the United States to facilitate the common defense by entering into international arrangements with friendly countries which further the objective of applying agreed resources of each country to pro", "grams and projects of cooperative exchange of data, research, development, production, procurement, and logistics support to achieve specific national defense requirements and objectives of mutual concern. To this end, this chapter authorizes sales by the United States Government to friendly countries having sufficient wealth to maintain and equip their own military forces at adequate strength, or to assume progressively larger shares of the costs thereof, without undue burden to their economies, in accordance with the restraints and control measures specified herein and in furtherance of the security objectives of the United States and of the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter.It is the sense of the Congress that all such sales be approved only when they are consistent with the foreign policy interests of the United States, the purposes of the foreign assistance program of the United States as embodied in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended [22 U.S.C. 2151It shall be the policy of the United States to exert leadership in the world community to bring about arrangements for reducing the international trade in implements of war and to lessen the danger of outbreak of regional conflict and the burdens of armaments. United States programs for or procedures governing the export, sale, and grant of defense articles and defense services to foreign countries and international organizations shall be administered in a manner which will carry out this policy.It is the sense of the Congress that the President should seek to initiate multilateral discussions for the purpose of reaching agreements among the principal arms suppliers and arms purchasers and other countries with respect to the control of the international trade in armaments. It is further the sense of Congress that the President should work actively with all nations to check and control the international sale and distribution of conventional weapons of death and destruction and to encourage regional arms control arrangements. In furt", "herance of this policy, the President should undertake a concerted effort to convene an international conference of major arms-supplying and arms-purchasing nations which shall consider measures to limit conventional arms transfers in the interest of international peace and stability.It is the sense of the Congress that the aggregate value of defense articles and defense services\u2014(1) which are sold under section 2761 or section 2762 of this title(2) which are licensed or approved for export under section 2778 of this titlein any fiscal year should not exceed current levels.It is the sense of the Congress that the President maintain adherence to a policy of restraint in conventional arms transfers and that, in implementing this policy worldwide, a balanced approach should be taken and full regard given to the security interests of the United States in all regions of the world and that particular attention should be paid to controlling the flow of conventional arms to the nations of the developing world. To this end, the President is encouraged to continue discussions with other arms suppliers in order to restrain the flow of conventional arms to less developed countries.(Pub.

Noncombatant civilians, including tens of thous", "ands of children, have been the primary victims.\u201c(2) Unlike other military weapons, landmines often remain implanted and undiscovered after conflict has ended, causing untold suffering to civilian populations. In Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Angola, tens of millions of unexploded landmines have rendered whole areas uninhabitable. In Afghanistan, an estimated hundreds of thousands of people have been maimed and killed by landmines during the 14-year civil war. In Cambodia, more than 20,000 civilians have lost limbs and another 60 are being maimed each month from landmines.\u201c(3) Over 35 countries are known to manufacture landmines, including the United States. However, the United States is not a major exporter of landmines. During the past ten years the Department of State has approved ten licenses for the commercial export of anti-personnel landmines valued at $980,000, and during the past five years the Department of Defense has approved the sale of 13,156 anti-personnel landmines valued at $841,145.\u201c(4) The United States signed, but has not ratified, the 1981 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed To Be Excessively Injurious or To Have Indiscriminate Effects. The Convention prohibits the indiscriminate use of landmines.\u201c(5) When it signed the Convention, the United States stated: \u2018We believe that the Convention represents a positive step forward in efforts to minimize injury or damage to the civilian population in time of armed conflict. Our signature of the Convention reflects the general willingness of the United States to adopt practical and reasonable provisions concerning the conduct of military operations, for the purpose of protecting noncombatants.\u2019.\u201c(6) The President should submit the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification, and the President should actively negotiate under United Nations auspices or other auspices an international agreement, or a modification of the Convention, to prohibit the sal", "e, transfer or export of anti-personnel landmines. Such an agreement or modification would be an appropriate response to the end of the Cold War and the promotion of arms control agreements to reduce the indiscriminate killing and maiming of civilians.\u201c(7) The United States should set an example for other countries in such negotiations, by implementing a one-year moratorium on the sale, transfer or export of anti-personnel landmines.\u201c(b) Statement of Policy(1) It shall be the policy of the United States to seek verifiable international agreements prohibiting the sale, transfer, or export, and further limiting the use, production, possession, and deployment of anti-personnel landmines.\u201c(2) It is the sense of the Congress that the President should actively seek to negotiate under United Nations auspices or other auspices an international agreement, or a modification of the Convention, to prohibit the sale, transfer, or export of anti-personnel landmines.\u201c(c) Moratorium on Transfers of Anti-Personnel Landmines AbroadDuring the 22 year period beginning on October 23, 1992\u201c(1) no sale may be made or financed, no transfer may be made, and no license for export may be issued, under the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2751\u201c(2) no assistance may be provided under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151\u201c(d) DefinitionFor purposes of this section, the term \u2018anti-personnel landmine\u2019 means\u2014\u201c(1) any munition placed under, on, or near the ground or other surface area, or delivered by artillery, rocket, mortar, or similar means or dropped from an aircraft and which is designed to be detonated or exploded by the presence, proximity, or contact of a person;\u201c(2) any device or material which is designed, constructed, or adapted to kill or injure and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object or performs an apparently safe act;\u201c(3) any manually-emplaced munition or device designed to kill, injure, or damage and which is actuated by remote control or automatically afte", "r a lapse of time.\u201d[Section 634(j) of title VI of div.

FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) nations in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, which accounted for over 40 percent of the international trade in weapons and related equipment and services during the decade of the 1980\u2019s, are the principal market for the worldwide arms trade;\u201c(2) regional instability, large financial resources, and the desire of arms-supplying governments to gain influence in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, contribute to a regional arms race;\u201c(3) the continued proliferation of weapons and related equipment and services contribute further to a regional arms race in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region that is politically, economically, and militarily destabilizing;\u201c(4) the continued proliferation of unconventional weapons, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, as well as delivery systems associated with those weapons, poses an urgent threat to security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region;\u201c(5) the continued proliferation of ballistic missile technologies and ballistic missile systems that are capable of delivering conventional, nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads undermines security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region;\u201c(6) future security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region would be enhanced by establishing a stable military balance among regional powers by restraining and reducing both conventional and unconventional weapons;\u201c(7) security, stability, peace, and prosperity in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region are important to the welfare of the internation", "al economy and to the national security interests of the United States;\u201c(8) future security and stability in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region would be enhanced through the development of a multilateral arms transfer and control regime similar to those of the Nuclear Suppliers\u2019 Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Australia Chemical Weapons Suppliers Group;\u201c(9) such a regime should be developed, implemented, and agreed to through multilateral negotiations, including under the auspices of the 5 permanent members of the United Nations Security Council;\u201c(10) confidence-building arms control measures such as the establishment of a centralized arms trade registry at the United Nations, greater multinational transparency on the transfer of defense articles and services prior to agreement or transfer, cooperative verification measures, advanced notification of military exercises, information exchanges, on-site inspections, and creation of a Middle East and Persian Gulf Conflict Prevention Center, are important to implement an effective multilateral arms transfer and control regime;\u201c(11) as an interim step, the United States should consider introducing, during the ongoing negotiations on confidence security-building measures at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) [now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe], a proposal regarding the international exchange of information, on an annual basis, on the sale and transfer of major military equipment, particularly to the Middle East and Persian Gulf region; and\u201c(12) such a regime should be applied to other regions with the ultimate objective of achieving an effective global arms transfer and control regime, implemented and enforced through the United Nations Security Council, that\u2014\u201c(A) includes a linkage of humanitarian and developmental objectives with security objectives in Third World countries, particularly the poorest of the poor countries; and\u201c(B) encourages countries selling military equipment and services to", " consider the following factors before making conventional arms sales: the security needs of the purchasing countries, the level of defense expenditures by the purchasing countries, and the level of indigenous production of the purchasing countries.\u201cSEC. 402. MULTILATERAL ARMS TRANSFER AND CONTROL REGIME.\u201c(a) Implementation of the Regime.\u2014\u201c(1) Continuing negotiationsThe President shall continue negotiations among the 5 permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and commit the United States to a multilateral arms transfer and control regime for the Middle East and Persian Gulf region.\u201c(2) Proposing a temporary moratorium during negotiationsIn the context of these negotiations, the President should propose to the 5 permanent members of the United Nations Security Council a temporary moratorium on the sale and transfer of major military equipment to nations in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region until such time as the 5 permanent members agree to a multilateral arms transfer and control regime.\u201c(b) Purpose of the RegimeThe purpose of the multilateral arms transfer and control regime should be\u2014\u201c(1) to slow and limit the proliferation of conventional weapons in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region with the aim of preventing destabilizing transfers by\u2014\u201c(A) controlling the transfer of conventional major military equipment;\u201c(B) achieving transparency among arms suppliers nations through advanced notification of agreement to, or transfer of, conventional major military equipment; and\u201c(C) developing and adopting common and comprehensive control guidelines on the sale and transfer of conventional major military equipment to the region;\u201c(2) to halt the proliferation of unconventional weapons, including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, as well as delivery systems associated with those weapons and the technologies necessary to produce or assemble such weapons;\u201c(3) to limit and halt the proliferation of ballistic missile technologies and ballistic missile systems that are capable of delivering con", "ventional, nuclear, biological, or chemical warheads;\u201c(4) to maintain the military balance in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region through reductions of conventional weapons and the elimination of unconventional weapons; and\u201c(5) to promote regional arms control in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region.\u201c(c) Achieving the Purposes of the Regime.\u2014\u201c(1) Controlling proliferation of conventional weaponsIn order to achieve the purposes described in subsection (b)(1), the United States should pursue the development of a multilateral arms transfer and control regime which includes\u2014\u201c(A) greater information-sharing practices among supplier nations regarding potential arms sales to all nations of the Middle East and Persian Gulf region;\u201c(B) applying, for the control of conventional major military equipment, procedures already developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Multilateral Coordinating Committee on Export Controls (COCOM), and the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR); and\u201c(C) other strict controls on the proliferation of conventional major military equipment to the Middle East and Persian Gulf region.\u201c(2) Halting proliferation of unconventional weaponsIn order to achieve the purposes described in subsections (b)(2) and (3), the United States should build on existing and future agreements among supplier nations by pursuing the development of a multilateral arms transfer and control regime which includes\u2014\u201c(A) limitations and controls contained in the Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative;\u201c(B) limitations and controls contained in the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR);\u201c(C) guidelines followed by the Australia Group on chemical and biological arms proliferation;\u201c(D) guidelines adopted by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (the London Group); and\u201c(E) other appropriate controls that serve to halt the flow of unconditional [unconventional] weapons to the Middle East and Persian Gulf region.\u201c(3) Promotion of regional arms control agreementsIn order to achieve the purposes described in subsections (", "b)(4) and (5), the United States should pursue with nations in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region\u2014\u201c(A) the maintenance of the military balance within the region, while eliminating nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and associated delivery systems, and ballistic missiles;\u201c(B) the implementation of confidence-building and security-building measures, including advance notification of certain ground and aerial military exercises in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf;
