The total volume of goods imported and exported through ports is expected to more than double over the next 20 years.\u201c(3) The variety of trade and commerce carried out at ports includes bulk cargo, containerized cargo, passenger transport and tourism, and intermodal transportation systems that are complex to secure.\u201c(4) The United States is increasingly dependent on imported energy for a substantial share of its energy supply, and a disruption of that share of supply would seriously harm consumers and our economy.\u201c(5) The top 50 ports in the United States account for about 90 percent of all the cargo tonnage. Twenty-five United States ports account for 98 percent of all container shipments. Cruise ships visiting foreign destinations embark from at least 16 ports. Ferries in the United States transport 113,000,000 passengers and 32,000,000 vehicles per year.\u201c(6) Ports often are a major locus of Federal crime, including drug trafficking, cargo theft, and smuggling of contraband and aliens.\u201c(7) Ports are often very open and exposed and are susceptible to large scale acts of terrorism that could cause a large loss of life or economic disruption.\u201c(8) Current inspection levels of containerized cargo are insufficient to counter potential security risks. Technology is currently not adequately deployed to allow for the nonintrusive inspection of containerized cargo.\u201c(9) The cruise ship industry poses a special risk from a security perspective.\u201c(10) Securing entry points and other areas of port facilities and examining or inspecting containers would increase security at United States ports.\u201c(11) Biometric identification procedures for individuals having access to secure area", "s in port facilities are important tools to deter and prevent port cargo crimes, smuggling, and terrorist actions.\u201c(12) United States ports are international boundaries that\u2014\u201c(A) are particularly vulnerable to breaches in security;\u201c(B) may present weaknesses in the ability of the United States to realize its national security objectives; and\u201c(C) may serve as a vector or target for terrorist attacks aimed at the United States.\u201c(13) It is in the best interests of the United States\u2014\u201c(A) to have a free flow of interstate and foreign commerce and to ensure the efficient movement of cargo;\u201c(B) to increase United States port security by establishing improving communication among law enforcement officials responsible for port security;\u201c(C) to formulate requirements for physical port security, recognizing the different character and nature of United States port facilities, and to require the establishment of security programs at port facilities;\u201c(D) to provide financial assistance to help the States and the private sector to increase physical security of United States ports;\u201c(E) to invest in long-term technology to facilitate the private sector development of technology that will assist in the nonintrusive timely detection of crime or potential crime at United States ports;\u201c(F) to increase intelligence collection on cargo and intermodal movements to address areas of potential threat to safety and security; and\u201c(G) to promote private sector procedures that provide for in-transit visibility and support law enforcement efforts directed at managing the security risks of cargo shipments.\u201c(14) On April 27, 1999\u201c(15) The International Maritime Organization and other similar international organizations are currently developing a new maritime security system that contains the essential elements for enhancing global maritime security. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the United States to implement new international instruments that establish such a system.\u201dMaritime Security Professional TrainingPub.

L. 102\u2013243, \u00a7\u202f2Dec. 20, 1991105 Stat. 2394\n\u201cThe Congress finds that:\u201c(1) The use of the telephone to market goods and services to the home and other businesses is now pervasive due to the increased use of cost-effective telemarketing techniques.\u201c(2) Over 30,000 businesses actively telemarket goods and services to business and residential customers.\u201c(3) More than 300,000 solicitors call more than 18,000,000 Americans every day.\u201c(4) Total United States sales generated through telemarketing amounted to $435,000,000,000 in 1990, a more than four-fold increase since 1984.\u201c(5) Unrestricted telemarketing, however, can be an intrusive invasion of privacy and, when an emergency or medical assistance telephone line is seized", ", a risk to public safety.\u201c(6) Many consumers are outraged over the proliferation of intrusive, nuisance calls to their homes from telemarketers.\u201c(7) Over half the States now have statutes restricting various uses of the telephone for marketing, but telemarketers can evade their prohibitions through interstate operations; therefore, Federal law is needed to control residential telemarketing practices.\u201c(8) The Constitution does not prohibit restrictions on commercial telemarketing solicitations.\u201c(9) Individuals\u2019 privacy rights, public safety interests, and commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telemarketing practices.\u201c(10) Evidence compiled by the Congress indicates that residential telephone subscribers consider automated or prerecorded telephone calls, regardless of the content or the initiator of the message, to be a nuisance and an invasion of privacy.\u201c(11) Technologies that might allow consumers to avoid receiving such calls are not universally available, are costly, are unlikely to be enforced, or place an inordinate burden on the consumer.\u201c(12) Banning such automated or prerecorded telephone calls to the home, except when the receiving party consents to receiving the call or when such calls are necessary in an emergency situation affecting the health and safety of the consumer, is the only effective means of protecting telephone consumers from this nuisance and privacy invasion.\u201c(13) While the evidence presented to the Congress indicates that automated or prerecorded calls are a nuisance and an invasion of privacy, regardless of the type of call, the Federal Communications Commission should have the flexibility to design different rules for those types of automated or pre\u00adrecorded calls that it finds are not considered a nuisance or invasion of privacy, or for noncommercial calls, consistent with the free speech protections embodied in the First Amendment of the Constitution.\u201c(14) Businesses also have complained to t", "he Congress and the Federal Communications Commission that automated or prerecorded telephone calls are a nuisance, are an invasion of privacy, and interfere with interstate commerce.\u201c(15) The Federal Communications Commission should consider adopting reasonable restrictions on automated or prerecorded calls to businesses as well as to the home, consistent with the constitutional protections of free speech.\u201d\nDefinitionPub.
