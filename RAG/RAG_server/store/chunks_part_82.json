It is the bridge between the laboratory and new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention and is thus essential to progress against cancer and other diseases.\u201c(4) The United States will spend more than $1,200,000,000,000 on health care in 1999, but the Federal budget for health research at the National Institutes of Health was $15,600,000,000 only 1 percent of that total.\u201c(5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have all addressed the current problems in clinical research.\u201c(6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has recognized the current problems in clinical research and appointed a special panel, which recommended expanded support for existing National Institutes of Health clinical research programs and the creation of new initiatives to recruit and retain clinical investigators.\u201c(7) The current level of training and support for health professionals in clinical research is fragmented, undervalued, and underfunded.\u201c(8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas in the day-to-day research that constitutes the scientific enterprise. Serious questions about the future of life-science research are raised by the following:\u201c(A) The number of young investigators applying for grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.\u201c(B) The number of physicians applying ", "for first-time National Institutes of Health research project grants fell from 1226 in 1994 to 963 in 1998, a 21 percent reduction.\u201c(C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise funds to support their new research programs and a substantial proportion of their own salaries.\u201c(9) The following have been cited as reasons for the decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and those choosing this career path:\u201c(A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt of $85,619, as reported in the Medical School Graduation Questionnaire by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).\u201c(B) The prolonged period of clinical training required increases the accumulated debt burden.\u201c(C) The decreasing number of mentors and role models.\u201c(D) The perceived instability of funding from the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies.\u201c(E) The almost complete absence of clinical research training in the curriculum of training grant awardees.\u201c(F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing difficulties in maintaining a proper environment for research in a highly competitive health care marketplace, which are compounded by the decreased willingness of third party payers to cover health care costs for patients engaged in research studies and research procedures.\u201c(10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were established under the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of $3,000,000.\u201c(11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers in fiscal year 1999 equaled $200,500,000.\u201c(12) Since the late 1960s, spending for general clinical research centers has declined from approximately 3 percent to 1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget.\u201c(13) In fiscal year 1999, there were 77 general clinical research centers in operation, supplying patients in the areas in which such centers operate with access to the most modern clinical research and clinical research facilities and technologies.\u201c(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this title [s", "ee Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 201 of this titleOversight by GAOPub.

L. 106\u2013580, \u00a7\u202f2Dec. 29, 2000114 Stat. 3088\n\u201cThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Basic research in imaging, bioengineering, computer science, informatics, and related fields is critical to improving health care but is fundamentally different from the research in molecular biology on which the current national research institutes at the National Institutes of Health (\u2018NIH\u2019) are based. To ensure the development of new techniques and technologies for the 21st century, these disciplines therefore require an identity and research home at the NIH that is independent of the existing institute structure.\u201c(2) Advances based on medical research promise new, more effective treatments for a wide variety of diseases, but the development of new, noninvasive imaging techniques for earlier detection and diagnosis of disease is essential to take full advantage of such new treatments and to promote the general improvement of health care.\u201c(3) The development of advanced genetic and molecular imaging techniques is necessary to continue the current rapid pace of discovery in molecular biology.\u201c(4) Advances in telemedicine, and teleradiology in particular, are increasingly important in the delivery of high quality, reliable medical care to rural citizens and other underserved populat", "ions. To fulfill the promise of telemedicine and related technologies fully, a structure is needed at the NIH to support basic research focused on the acquisition, transmission, processing, and optimal display of images.\u201c(5) A number of Federal departments and agencies support imaging and engineering research with potential medical applications, but a central coordinating body, preferably housed at the NIH, is needed to coordinate these disparate efforts and facilitate the transfer of technologies with medical applications.\u201c(6) Several breakthrough imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (\u2018MRI\u2019) and computed tomography (\u2018CT\u2019), have been developed primarily abroad, in large part because of the absence of a home at the NIH for basic research in imaging and related fields. The establishment of a central focus for imaging and bioengineering research at the NIH would promote both scientific advance and United States economic development.\u201c(7) At a time when a consensus exists to add significant resources to the NIH in coming years, it is appropriate to modernize the structure of the NIH to ensure that research dollars are expended more effectively and efficiently and that the fields of medical science that have contributed the most to the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease in recent years receive appropriate emphasis.\u201c(8) The establishment of a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the NIH would accelerate the development of new technologies with clinical and research applications, improve coordination and efficiency at the NIH and throughout the Federal Government, reduce duplication and waste, lay the foundation for a new medical information age, promote economic development, and provide a structure to train the young researchers who will make the pathbreaking discoveries of the next century.\u201dEstablishment of Institute and Advisory CouncilPub.

L. 106\u2013525, \u00a7\u202f2Nov. 22, 2000114 Stat. 2495\n\u201cThe Congress finds as follows:\u201c(1) Despite notable progress in the overall health of the Nation, there are continuing disparities in the burden of illness and death experienced by African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Asian Pacific Islanders, compared to the United States population as a whole.\u201c(2) The largest numbers of the medically underserved are white individuals, and many of them have the same health care access problems as do members of minority groups. Nearly 20,000,000 white individuals live below the poverty line with many living in nonmetropolitan, rural areas such as Appalachia, where the high percentage of counties designated as health professional shortage areas (47 percent) and the high rate of poverty contribute to disparity outcomes. However, there is a higher proportion", " of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States represented among the medically underserved.\u201c(3) There is a national need for minority scientists in the fields of biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and health services research. Ninety percent of minority physicians educated at Historically Black Medical Colleges live and serve in minority communities.\u201c(4) Demographic trends inspire concern about the Nation\u2019s ability to meet its future scientific, technological, and engineering workforce needs. Historically, non-Hispanic white males have made up the majority of the United States scientific, technological, and engineering workers.\u201c(5) The Hispanic and Black population will increase significantly in the next 50 years. The scientific, technological, and engineering workforce may decrease if participation by underrepresented minorities remains the same.\u201c(6) Increasing rates of Black and Hispanic workers can help ensure a strong scientific, technological, and engineering workforce.\u201c(7) Individuals such as underrepresented minorities and women in the scientific, technological, and engineering workforce enable society to address its diverse needs.\u201c(8) If there had not been a substantial increase in the number of science and engineering degrees awarded to women and underrepresented minorities over the past few decades, the United States would be facing even greater shortages in scientific, technological, and engineering workers.\u201c(9) In order to effectively promote a diverse and strong 21st century scientific, technological, and engineering workforce, Federal agencies should expand or add programs that effectively overcome barriers such as educational transition from one level to the next and student requirements for financial resources.\u201c(10) Federal agencies should work in concert with the private nonprofit sector to emphasize the recruitment and retention of qualified individuals from ethnic and gender groups that are currently underrepresented in the scientific, technological, and engineering workforce.\u201c(11) Behavi", "oral and social sciences research has increased awareness and understanding of factors associated with health care utilization and access, patient attitudes toward health services, and risk and protective behaviors that affect health and illness. These factors have the potential to then be modified to help close the health disparities gap among ethnic minority populations. In addition, there is a shortage of minority behavioral science researchers and behavioral health care professionals. According to the National Science Foundation, only 15.5 percent of behavioral research-oriented psychology doctorate degrees were awarded to minority students in 1997. In addition, only 17.9 percent of practice-oriented psychology doctorate degrees were awarded to ethnic minorities.\u201dPublic Awareness and Dissemination of Information on Health DisparitiesPub.

Such diseases and conditions include Huntington\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), Tourette syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease, cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\u201c(2) For many years, the 25,000,000 Americans suffering from the over 6,000 rare diseases and disorders were denied access to effective medicines because prescription drug manufacturers could rarely make a profit from marketing drugs for such small groups of patients. The prescription drug industry did not adequately fund research into such treatments. Despite the urgent health need for these medicines, they came to be known as \u2018orphan drugs\u2019 because no companies would commercialize them.\u201c(3) During the 19", "70s, an organization called the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) was founded to provide services and to lobby on behalf of patients with rare diseases and disorders. NORD was instrumental in pressing Congress for legislation to encourage the development of orphan drugs.\u201c(4) The Orphan Drug Act [Pub. L. 97\u2013414section 301 of Title 21\u201c(5) Before 1983, some 38 orphan drugs had been developed. Since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act [Jan. 4, 1983\u201c(6) Despite the tremendous success of the Orphan Drug Act, rare diseases and disorders deserve greater emphasis in the national biomedical research enterprise. The Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health was created in 1993, but lacks a statutory authorization.\u201c(7) The National Institutes of Health has received a substantial increase in research funding from Congress for the purpose of expanding the national investment of the United States in behavioral and biomedical research.\u201c(8) Notwithstanding such increases, funding for rare diseases and disorders at the National Institutes of Health has not increased appreciably.\u201c(9) To redress this oversight, the Department of Health and Human Services has proposed the establishment of a network of regional centers of excellence for research on rare diseases.\u201c(b) PurposesThe purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendments note set out under section 201 of this title\u201c(1) amend the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201\u201c(2) increase the national investment in the development of diagnostics and treatments for patients with rare diseases and disorders.\u201d \u00a7\u202f287a\u20132.

L. 108\u2013355, \u00a7\u202f2Oct. 21, 2004118 Stat. 1404\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) More children and young adults die from suicide each year than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, and chronic lung disease combined.\u201c(2) Over 4,000 children and young adults tragically take their lives every year, making suicide the third overall cause of death between the ages of 10 and 24. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third overall cause of death among college-age students.\u201c(3) According to the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, children and young adults accounted for 15 percent of all suicides completed in 2000.\u201c(4) From 1952 to 1995, the rate of suicide in children and young adults tripled.\u201c(5) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among young adults ages 15 to 19 increased 11 percent.\u201c(6) From 1980 to 1997, the rate of suicide among children ages 10 to 14 increased 109 percent.\u201c(7) According to the National Center of Health Statistics, suicide rates among Native Americans range from 1.5 to 3 times the national average for other groups, with young people ages 15 to 34 making up 64 percent of all suicides.\u201c(8) Congress has recognized that youth suicide is a public health tragedy linked to underlying mental health problems and that youth suicide early intervention and prevention activities are national priorities.\u201c(9) Youth suicide early intervention and prevention have been listed as urgent public health priorities by the President\u2019s New Freedom Commission in [probably should be \u201con\u201d] Mental Health (2002), the Institute of Medicine\u2019s Reducing Suicide: A National Imperative (2002), the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention: Goals and Objectives for Action (2001), and the Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action To Prevent Suicide (1999).\u201c(10) Many States", " have already developed comprehensive statewide youth suicide early intervention and prevention strategies that seek to provide effective early intervention and prevention services.\u201c(11) In a recent report, a startling 85 percent of college counseling centers revealed an increase in the number of students they see with psychological problems. Furthermore, the American College Health Association found that 61 percent of college students reported feeling hopeless, 45 percent said they felt so depressed they could barely function, and 9 percent felt suicidal.\u201c(12) There is clear evidence of an increased incidence of depression among college students. According to a survey described in the Chronicle of Higher Education (February 1, 2002\u201c(13) Researchers who conducted the study \u2018Changes in Counseling Center Client Problems Across 13 Years\u2019 (1989\u20132001) at Kansas State University stated that \u2018students are experiencing more stress, more anxiety, more depression than they were a decade ago.\u2019 (The Chronicle of Higher Education, February 14, 2003\u201c(14) According to the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 20 percent of full-time undergraduate college students use illicit drugs.\u201c(15) The 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse also reported that 18.4 percent of adults aged 18 to 24 are dependent on or abusing illicit drugs or alcohol. In addition, the study found that \u2018serious mental illness is highly correlated with substance dependence or abuse. Among adults with serious mental illness in 2001, 20.3 percent were dependent on or abused alcohol or illicit drugs, while the rate among adults without serious mental illness was only 6.3 percent.\u2019.\u201c(16) A 2003 Gallagher\u2019s Survey of Counseling Center Directors found that 81 percent were concerned about the increasing number of students with more serious psychological problems, 67 percent reported a need for more psychiatric services, and 63 percent reported problems with growing demand for services without an appropriate increase in resources.\u201c(17) The International A", "ssociation of Counseling Services accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per 1,000 to 1,500 students. According to the 2003 Gallagher\u2019s Survey of Counseling Center Directors, the ratio of counselors to students is as high as 1 counselor per 2,400 students at institutions of higher education with more than 15,000 students.\u201d \u00a7\u202f290bb\u201336a.
