or(4) substantial evidence (which may be evidence on the record at the time any prior determination of the entitlement to benefits based on disability was made, or newly obtained evidence which relates to that determination) which demonstrates that a prior determination was in error.Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a determination that a recipient of benefits under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII based on an individual\u2019s disability is entitled to such benefits if the prior determination was fraudulently obtained or if the individual is engaged in substantial gainful activity, cannot be located, or fails, without good cause, to cooperate in a review of the entitlement to such benefits or to follow presc", "ribed treatment which would be expected to restore his or her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. In making for purposes of the preceding sentence any determination relating to fraudulent behavior by any individual or failure by any individual without good cause to cooperate or to take any required action, the Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation such individual may have (including any lack of facility with the English language). Any determination under this section shall be made on the basis of all the evidence available in the individual\u2019s case file, including new evidence concerning the individual\u2019s prior or current condition which is presented by the individual or secured by the Commissioner of Social Security.

L. 104\u2013193, title I, \u00a7\u202f101Aug. 22, 1996110 Stat. 2110\n\u201cThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.\u201c(2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful society which promotes the interests of children.\u201c(3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherh", "ood is integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of children.\u201c(4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families with children had a child support order established and, of that 54 percent, only about one-half received the full amount due. Of the cases enforced through the public child support enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a collection.\u201c(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families with dependent children (in this section referred to as \u2018AFDC\u2019) has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-thirds of these recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent of children receiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no father is present.\u201c(A)(i) The average monthly number of children receiving AFDC benefits\u2014\u201c(I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;\u201c(II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;\u201c(III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and\u201c(IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.\u201c(ii) While the number of children receiving AFDC benefits increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, the total number of children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has declined by 5.5 percent.\u201c(B) The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC benefits within 10 years.\u201c(C) The increase in the number of children receiving public assistance is closely related to the increase in births to unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percentage of live births to unmarried women increased nearly threefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.\u201c(6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births is well documented as follows:\u201c(A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teen pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991. The overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 14 percent from 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980 to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overall pregnancy rate for married couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980 and 1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 to 1", "17.6 pregnancies in 1991.\u201c(B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970 and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent and if the current trend continues, 50 percent of all births by the year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.\u201c(7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy must address the issue of male responsibility, including statutory rape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are significantly older.\u201c(A) It is estimated that in the late 1980\u2019s, the rate for girls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.\u201c(B) Data indicates that at least half of the children born to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Available data suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls are fathered by men over age 20.\u201c(C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that a majority of such mothers have histories of sexual and physical abuse, primarily with older adult men.\u201c(8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on the mother, the child, the family, and society are well documented as follows:\u201c(A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outside of marriage are more likely to go on public assistance and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These combined effects of \u2018younger and longer\u2019 increase total AFDC costs per household by 25 percent to 30 percent for 17-year-olds.\u201c(B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantially higher risk of being born at a very low or moderately low birth weight.\u201c(C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as more child abuse, and neglect.\u201c(D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.\u201c(E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces the chances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.\u201c(F) Children born out-of-we", "dlock are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up.\u201c(9) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homes were born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that of children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced (37 percent). While many parents find themselves, through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing the difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children in single-parent homes are well documented as follows:\u201c(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with children under 18 years of age have income below the national poverty level. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headed households with children under 18 years of age are below the national poverty level.\u201c(B) Among single-parent families, nearly \u00bd of the mothers who never married received AFDC while only \u2155 of divorced mothers received AFDC.\u201c(C) Children born into families receiving welfare assistance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they reach adulthood than children not born into families receiving welfare.\u201c(D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatest risk of bearing low birth weight babies.\u201c(E) The younger the single-parent mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.\u201c(F) Young women who have children before finishing high school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a longer period of time.\u201c(G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of births to teenage mothers under the aid to families with dependent children program, the food stamp program, and the medicaid program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.\u201c(H) The absence of a father in the life of a child has a negative effect on school performance and peer adjustment.\u201c(I) Children of teenage single parents have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.\u201c(J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times more likely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than are children fr", "om intact 2-parent families.\u201c(K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.\u201c(L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youth aged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages of single-parent households have higher rates of violent crime.\u201c(M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses within the State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived primarily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000 children in the Nation\u2019s resident population were living with both parents.\u201c(10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisis in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock birth are very important Government interests and the policy contained in part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601[References to the food stamp program established under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 considered to refer to the supplemental nutrition assistance program established under that Act, see section 4002(c) of Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018Assets for Independence Act\u2019.\u201cSEC. 402. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can improve economic independence and stability, connect individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate development of human and other capital, and enhance the welfare of offspring.\u201c(2) Fully \u00bd of all Americans have either no, negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of a house, an adequate education, and sta", "rting a business, is increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United States lags far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to economic growth.\u201c(3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United States should invest existing resources in high-yield initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial returns, including increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash assistance, resulting from individual development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment in those accounts.\u201c(4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on income and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-based policies provide the means to achieve greater independence and economic well-being.\u201cSEC. 403. PURPOSES.\u201cThe purposes of this title are to provide for the establishment of demonstration projects designed to determine\u2014\u201c(1) the social, civic, psychological, and economic effects of providing to individuals and families with limited means an incentive to accumulate assets by saving a portion of their earned income;\u201c(2) the extent to which an asset-based policy that promotes saving for postsecondary education, homeownership, and microenterprise development may be used to enable individuals and families with limited means to increase their economic self-sufficiency; and\u201c(3) the extent to which an asset-based policy stabilizes and improves families and the community in which the families live.\u201cSEC. 404. DEFINITIONS.\u201cIn this title:\u201c(1) Applicable periodThe term \u2018applicable period\u2019 means, with respect to amounts to be paid from a grant made for a project year, the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which the grant is made.\u201c(2) Eligible individualThe term \u2018eligible", " individual\u2019 means an individual who is selected to participate in a demonstration project by a qualified entity under section 409.\u201c(3) Emergency withdrawalThe term \u2018emergency withdrawal\u2019 means a withdrawal by an eligible individual that\u2014\u201c(A) is a withdrawal of only those funds, or a portion of those funds, deposited by the individual in the individual development account of the individual;\u201c(B) is permitted by a qualified entity on a case-by-case basis;

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can improve economic independence and stability, connect individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate development of human and other capital, and enhance the welfare of offspring.\u201c(2) Fully \u00bd of all Americans have either no, negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of a house, an adequate education, and starting a business, is increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United States lags far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to economic growth.\u201c(3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United States should invest existing resources in high-yield initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial returns, i", "ncluding increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash assistance, resulting from individual development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment in those accounts.\u201c(4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on income and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-based policies provide the means to achieve greater independence and economic well-being. \u201cSEC. 403. PURPOSES.\u201cThe purposes of this title are to provide for the establishment of demonstration projects designed to determine\u2014\u201c(1) the social, civic, psychological, and economic effects of providing to individuals and families with limited means an incentive to accumulate assets by saving a portion of their earned income;\u201c(2) the extent to which an asset-based policy that promotes saving for postsecondary education, homeownership, and microenterprise development may be used to enable individuals and families with limited means to increase their economic self-sufficiency; and\u201c(3) the extent to which an asset-based policy stabilizes and improves families and the community in which the families live. \u201cSEC. 404.

L. 109\u2013288, \u00a7\u202f2Sept. 28, 2006120 Stat. 1233\n\u201cThe Congress finds as follows:\u201c(1) For Federal fiscal year 2004, child protective services (CPS) staff nationwide reported investigating or assessing an estimated 3,000,000 allegations of child maltreatment, and determined that 872,000 children had been abused or neglected by their parents or other caregivers.\u201c(2) Combined, the Child Welfare Services (CWS) and Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) programs provide States about $700,000,000 per year, the largest source of targeted Federal funding in the child protection system for services to ensure that children are not abused or neglected and, whenever possible, help children remain safely with their families.\u201c(3) A 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that little research is available on the effectiveness of", " activities supported by CWS funds\u2014evaluations of services supported by PSSF funds have generally shown little or no effect.\u201c(4) Further, the Department of Health and Human Services recently completed initial Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSRs) in each State. No State was in full compliance with all measures of the CFSRs. The CFSRs also revealed that States need to work to prevent repeat abuse and neglect of children, improve services provided to families to reduce the risk of future harm (including by better monitoring the participation of families in services), and strengthen upfront services provided to families to prevent unnecessary family break-up and protect children who remain at home.\u201c(5) Federal policy should encourage States to invest their CWS and PSSF funds in services that promote and protect the welfare of children, support strong, healthy families, and reduce the reliance on out-of-home care, which will help ensure all children are raised in safe, loving families.\u201c(6) CFSRs also found a strong correlation between frequent caseworker visits with children and positive outcomes for these children, such as timely achievement of permanency and other indicators of child well-being.\u201c(7) However, a December 2005 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that only 20 States were able to produce reports to show whether caseworkers actually visited children in foster care on at least a monthly basis, despite the fact that nearly all States had written standards suggesting monthly visits were State policy.\u201c(8) A 2003 GAO report found that the average tenure for a child welfare caseworker is less than 2 years and this level of turnover negatively affects safety and permanency for children.\u201c(9) Targeting CWS and PSSF funds to ensure children in foster care are visited on at least a monthly basis will promote better outcomes for vulnerable children, including by preventing further abuse and neglect.\u201c(10) According to the Office of Applied Studies of the Substanc", "e Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the annual number of new uses of Methamphetamine, also known as \u2018meth,\u2019 has increased 72 percent over the past decade. According to a study conducted by the National Association of Counties which surveyed 500 county law enforcement agencies in 45 states, 88 percent of the agencies surveyed reported increases in meth related arrests starting 5 years ago.\u201c(11) According to the 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, nearly 12,000,000 Americans have tried methamphetamine. Meth making operations have been uncovered in all 50 states, but the most wide-spread abuse has been concentrated in the western, southwestern, and Midwestern United States.\u201c(12) Methamphetamine abuse is on the increase, particularly among women of child-bearing age. This is having an impact on child welfare systems in many States. According to a survey administered by the National Association of Counties (\u2018The Impact of Meth on Children\u2019), conducted in 300 counties in 13 states, meth is a major cause of child abuse and neglect. Forty percent of all the child welfare officials in the survey reported an increase in out-of-home placements because of meth in 2005.\u201c(13) It is appropriate also to target PSSF funds to address this issue because of the unique strain the meth epidemic puts on child welfare agencies. Outcomes for children affected by meth are enhanced when services provided by law enforcement, child welfare and substance abuse agencies are integrated.\u201d \u00a7\u202f622.

L. 106\u2013314Oct. 17, 2000114 Stat. 1266\n\u201cSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 2000\u2019.\u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a crucial and essential role in the Nation\u2019s child welfare system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children under the supervision of that system.\u201c(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105\u201389111 Stat. 2115section 1305 of this title\u201c(3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by requiring timely decisionmaking in proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their families or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the foster care system.\u201c(4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 specifically requires, among other things, that States move to terminate the parental rights", " of the parents of those children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months.\u201c(5) While essential to protect children and to carry out the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that Act increase the pressure on the Nation\u2019s already overburdened abuse and neglect courts.\u201c(6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would be substantially improved by the acquisition and implementation of computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe and stable families. Such systems could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.\u201c(7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by the identification and implementation of projects designed to eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing caseloads.\u201c(8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would be further strengthened by improving the quality and availability of training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who represent the children and the parents of children in abuse and neglect proceedings.\u201c(9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this country are already committed to the quality administration of justice, the performance of such courts would be even further enhanced by the development of models and educational opportunities that reinforce court projects", " that have already been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, case management, representation of children, automated interagency interfaces, and \u2018best practices\u2019 standards.\u201c(10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that proceedings in our Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts are run efficiently and effectively. The performance of those individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange ideas with their peers.\u201c(11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court system. The Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would benefit from an expansion of this program to currently underserved communities.\u201c(12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by reducing the average length of an abused and neglected child\u2019s stay in foster care, improving the quality of decision-making and court services provided to children and families, and increasing the number of adoptions.\u201cSEC. 3.

Strengthening the Child Welfare System for America\u2019s ChildrenEx. Ord. No. 13930, June 24, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPurposeThe best foster care system is one that is not needed i", "n the first place. My Administration has been focused on prevention strategies that keep children safe while strengthening families so that children do not enter foster care unnecessarily. Last year, and for only the second time since 2011, the number of children in the foster care system declined, and for the third year in a row, the number of children entering foster care has declined.But challenges remain. Too many young people who are in our foster care system wait years before finding the permanency of family. More than 400,000 children are currently in foster care. Of those, more than 124,000 children are waiting for adoption, with nearly 6 out of 10 (58.4 percent) having already become legally eligible for adoption.More than 50 percent of the children waiting for adoption have been in foster care\u2014without the security and constancy of a permanent family\u2014for 2 years or more. The need for stability and timely permanency is particularly acute for children 9 years and older, children in sibling groups, and those with intellectual or physical disabilities.Even worse, too many young men and women age out of foster care having never found a permanent, stable family. In recent years, approximately 20,000 young people have aged out of foster care each year in the United States. Research has shown that young people who age out of the foster care system are likely to experience significant, and significantly increased, life challenges\u201440 percent of such young people studied experienced homelessness; 50 percent were unemployed at age 24; 25 percent experienced post-traumatic stress disorder; and 71 percent became pregnant by age 21. These are unacceptable outcomes.Several factors have contributed to the number of children who wait in foster care for extended periods. First, State and local child welfare agencies often do not have robust partnerships with private community organizations, including faith-based organizations. Second, those who step up to be resource families for children in foster care\u2014including kin, guar", "dians, foster parents, and adoptive parents\u2014may lack adequate support. Third, too often the processes and systems meant to help children and families in crisis have instead created bureaucratic barriers that make it more difficult for these children and families to get the help they need.It is the goal of the United States to promote a child welfare system that reduces the need to place children into foster care; achieves safe permanency for those children who must come into foster care, and does so more quickly and more effectively; places appropriate focus on children who are waiting for adoption, especially those who are 9 years and older, are in sibling groups, or have disabilities; and decreases the proportion of young adults who age out of the foster care system.Children from all backgrounds have the potential to become successful and thriving adults. Yet without a committed, loving family that can provide encouragement, stability, and a lifelong connection, some children may never receive the support needed to realize that potential.This order will help to empower families who answer the call to open their hearts and homes to children who need them. My Administration is committed to helping give as many children as possible the stability and support that family provides by dramatically improving our child welfare system.Sec.Encouraging Robust Partnerships Between State Agencies and Public, Private, Faith-based, and Community Organizations(i) Publishing data to aid in the recruitment of community support.

Trump. \u201cSECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 2000\u2019. \u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a crucial and essential role in the Nation\u2019s child welfare system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children under the supervision of that system.\u201c(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105\u201389111 Stat. 2115section 1305 of this title\u201c(3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by requiring timely decisionmaking in proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their families or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the foster care system.\u201c(4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 specifically requires, among other things, that States move to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months.\u201c(5) While essential to protect children and to carry out the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that Act increase the pressure on the Nation\u2019s already overburdened abuse and neglect courts.\u201c(6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would be substantially improved by the acquisition and implementa", "tion of computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe and stable families. Such systems could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.\u201c(7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by the identification and implementation of projects designed to eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing caseloads.\u201c(8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would be further strengthened by improving the quality and availability of training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who represent the children and the parents of children in abuse and neglect proceedings.\u201c(9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this country are already committed to the quality administration of justice, the performance of such courts would be even further enhanced by the development of models and educational opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, case management, representation of children, automated interagency interfaces, and \u2018best practices\u2019 standards.\u201c(10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that proceedings in our Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts are run efficiently and effectively. The performance of those individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange ideas with their peers.\u201c(11) Volunteer", "s who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court system. The Nation\u2019s abuse and neglect courts would benefit from an expansion of this program to currently underserved communities.\u201c(12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by reducing the average length of an abused and neglected child\u2019s stay in foster care, improving the quality of decision-making and court services provided to children and families, and increasing the number of adoptions. \u201cSEC. 3.
