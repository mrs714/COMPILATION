A, title XIII, \u00a7\u202f1321Oct. 23, 1992106 Stat. 2549\n\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) On February 1, 1992\u201c(2) In the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in exchange for the non-nuclear-weapon states agreeing not to seek a nuclear weapons capability nor to assist other non-nuclear-weapon states in doing so, the United", " States agreed to seek the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons worldwide, as declared in the preamble to the Treaty, which states that it is a goal of the parties to the Treaty to \u2018facilitate the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons, the liquidation of all their existing stockpiles, and the elimination from national arsenals of nuclear weapons and the means of their delivery\u2019 as well as in Article VI of the Treaty, which states that \u2018each of the parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament\u2019.\u201c(3) Carrying out a policy of seeking further significant and continuous reductions in the nuclear arsenals of all countries, besides reducing the likelihood of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increasing the likelihood of a successful extension and possible strengthening of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 1995, when the Treaty is scheduled for review and possible extension, has additional benefits to the national security of the United States, including\u2014\u201c(A) a reduced risk of accidental enablement and launch of a nuclear weapon, and\u201c(B) a defense cost savings which could be reallocated for deficit reduction or other important national needs.\u201c(4) The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) Treaty and the agreement by the President of the United States and the President of the Russian Federation on June 17, 1992\u201c(5) The current international era of cooperation provides greater opportunities for achieving worldwide reduction and control of nuclear weapons and material than any time since the emergence of nuclear weapons 50 years ago.\u201c(6) It is in the security interests of both the United States and the world community for the President and the Congress to begin the process of reducing the number of nuclear weapons in every country through multilateral agreements and other appropriate means.\u201c(7) In a 1991 study, a committee of the National", " Academy of Sciences concluded that: \u2018The appropriate new levels of nuclear weapons cannot be specified at this time, but it seems reasonable to the committee that U.S. strategic forces could in time be reduced to 1,000\u20132,000 nuclear warheads, provided that such a multilateral agreement included appropriate levels and verification measures for the other nations that possess nuclear weapons. This step would require successful implementation of our proposed post-START U.S.-Soviet reductions, related confidence-building measures in all the countries involved, and multilateral security cooperation in areas such as conventional force deployments and planning.\u2019.\u201c(b) United States PolicyIt shall be the goal of the United States\u2014\u201c(1) to encourage and facilitate the denuclearization of Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan, as agreed upon in the Lisbon ministerial meeting of May 23, 1992\u201c(2) to rapidly complete and submit for ratification by the United States the treaty incorporating the agreement of June 17, 1992\u201c(3) to facilitate the ability of the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Byelarus, and Kazakhstan to implement agreed mutual reductions under the START Treaty, and under the Joint Understanding of June 16\u201317, 1992 between the United States and the Russian Federation, on an accelerated timetable, so that all such reductions can be completed by the year 2000;\u201c(4) to build on the agreement reached in the Joint Understanding of June 16\u201317, 1992, by entering into multilateral negotiations with the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, France, and the People\u2019s Republic of China, and, at an appropriate point in that process, enter into negotiations with other nuclear armed states in order to reach subsequent stage-by-stage agreements to achieve further reductions in the number of nuclear weapons in all countries;\u201c(5) to continue and extend cooperative discussions with the appropriate authorities of the former Soviet military on means to maintain and improve secure command and control over nuclear forces;\u201c(6) in consultation wit", "h other member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other allies, to initiate discussions to bring tactical nuclear weapons into the arms control process; and\u201c(7) to ensure that the United States assistance to securely transport and store, and ultimately dismantle, former Soviet nuclear weapons and missiles for such weapons is being properly and effectively utilized.\u201c(c) Annual ReportBy February 1 of each year, the President shall submit to the Congress a report on\u2014\u201c(1) the actions that the United States has taken, and the actions the United States plans to take during the next 12 months, to achieve each of the goals set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b); and\u201c(2) the actions that have been taken by the Russian Federation, by other former Soviet republics, and by other countries to achieve those goals.Each such report shall be submitted in unclassified form, with a classified appendix if necessary.\u201d \u00a7\u202f5902.

FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) The government of Fidel Castro has demonstrated consistent disregard for internationally accepted standards of human rights and for democratic values. It restricts the Cuban people\u2019s exercise of freedom of speech, press, assembly, and other rights recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 10, 1948(2) The Cuban people have demonstrated their yearning for freedom and their increasing opposition to the Castro government by risking their lives in organizing independent, democratic activities on the island and by undertaking hazardous flights for freedom to the United States and other countries.(3) The Castro government maintains a military-dominated economy that has decreased the well-being of the Cuban people in order to enable the government to engage in military interventions and subversive activities throughout the world and, especially, in the Western Hemisphere. These have included involvement in narcotics trafficking and support for the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador.(4) There is no sign that the Castro regime is prepared to make any significant concessions to democracy or to undertake any form of democratic opening. Efforts to suppress dissent through intimidation, imprisonment, and exile ha", "ve accelerated since the political changes that have occurred in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.(5) Events in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have dramatically reduced Cuba\u2019s external support and threaten Cuba\u2019s food and oil supplies.(6) The fall of communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the now universal recognition in Latin America and the Caribbean that Cuba provides a failed model of government and development, and the evident inability of Cuba\u2019s economy to survive current trends, provide the United States and the international democratic community with an unprecedented opportunity to promote a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba.(7) However, Castro\u2019s intransigence increases the likelihood that there could be a collapse of the Cuban economy, social upheaval, or widespread suffering. The recently concluded Cuban Communist Party Congress has underscored Castro\u2019s unwillingness to respond positively to increasing pressures for reform either from within the party or without.(8) The United States cooperated with its European and other allies to assist the difficult transitions from Communist regimes in Eastern Europe.

FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) The economy of Cuba has experienced a decline of at least 60 percent in the last 5 years as a result of\u2014(A) the end of its subsidization by the former Soviet Union of between 5 billion and 6 billion dollars annually;(B) 36 years of communist tyranny and economic mismanagement by the Castro government;(C) the extreme decline in trade between Cuba and the countries of the former Soviet bloc; and(D) the stated policy of the Russian Government and the countries of the former Soviet bloc to conduct economic relations with Cuba on strictly commercial terms.(2) At the same time, the welfare and health of the Cuban people have substantially deteriorated as a result of this economic decline and the refusal of the Castro regime to permit free and fair democratic elections in Cuba.(3) The Castro regime has made it abundantly clear that it will not engage in any substantive political reforms that would lead to democracy, a market economy, or an economic recovery.(4) The repression of the Cuban people, including a ban on free and fair democratic elections, and continuing violations of fundamental human rights, have isolated the Cuban regime as the only completely nondemocratic government in the Western Hemisphere.(5) As long as free elections are not held in Cuba, the economic condition of the country and the welfare of the Cuban people will not improve in any significant way.(6) The totalitarian nature of the Castro regime has deprived the Cuban people of any peaceful means to improve their condition and has led thousands of Cuban citizens to risk or lose ", "their lives in dangerous attempts to escape from Cuba to freedom.(7) Radio Marti and Television Marti have both been effective vehicles for providing the people of Cuba with news and information and have helped to bolster the morale of the people of Cuba living under tyranny.(8) The consistent policy of the United States towards Cuba since the beginning of the Castro regime, carried out by both Democratic and Republican administrations, has sought to keep faith with the people of Cuba, and has been effective in sanctioning the totalitarian Castro regime.(9) The United States has shown a deep commitment, and considers it a moral obligation, to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms as expressed in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.(10) The Congress has historically and consistently manifested its solidarity and the solidarity of the American people with the democratic aspirations of the Cuban people.(11) The Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 [22 U.S.C. 6001(12) Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151(13) The Cuban Government engages in the illegal international narcotics trade and harbors fugitives from justice in the United States.(14) The Castro government threatens international peace and security by engaging in acts of armed subversion and terrorism such as the training and supplying of groups dedicated to international violence.(15) The Castro government has utilized from its inception and continues to utilize torture in various forms (including by psychiatry), as well as execution, exile, confiscation, political imprisonment, and other forms of terror and repression, as means of retaining power.(16) Fidel Castro has defined democratic pluralism as \u201cpluralistic garbage\u201d and continues to make clear that he has no intention of tolerating the democratization of Cuban society.(17) The Castro government holds innocent Cubans hostage in Cuba by no fault of the hostages themselves solely because relatives have escaped the country.", "(18) Although a signatory state to the 1928 Inter-American Convention on Asylum and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (which protects the right to leave one\u2019s own country), Cuba nevertheless surrounds embassies in its capital by armed forces to thwart the right of its citizens to seek asylum and systematically denies that right to the Cuban people, punishing them by imprisonment for seeking to leave the country and killing them for attempting to do so (as demonstrated in the case of the confirmed murder of over 40 men, women, and children who were seeking to leave Cuba on July 13, 1994(19) The Castro government continues to utilize blackmail, such as the immigration crisis with which it threatened the United States in the summer of 1994, and other unacceptable and illegal forms of conduct to influence the actions of sovereign states in the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Charter of the Organization of American States and other international agreements and international law.(20) The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly reported on the unacceptable human rights situation in Cuba and has taken the extraordinary step of appointing a Special Rapporteur.(21) The Cuban Government has consistently refused access to the Special Rapporteur and formally expressed its decision not to \u201cimplement so much as one comma\u201d of the United Nations Resolutions appointing the Rapporteur.(22) The United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution 47\u2013139 on December 18, 1992December 20, 1993December 23, 1994(23) Article 39 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter provides that the United Nations Security Council \u201cshall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken .\u2000.\u2000., to maintain or restore international peace and security.\u201d.(24) The United Nations has determined that massive and systematic violations of human rights may constitute a \u201cthreat to peace\u201d under Article 3", "9 and has imposed sanctions due to such violations of human rights in the cases of Rhodesia, South Africa, Iraq, and the former Yugoslavia.(25) In the case of Haiti, a neighbor of Cuba not as close to the United States as Cuba, the United States led an effort to obtain and did obtain a United Nations Security Council embargo and blockade against that country due to the existence of a military dictatorship in power less than 3 years.(26) United Nations Security Council Resolution 940 of July 31, 1994October 15, 1994(27) The Cuban people deserve to be assisted in a decisive manner to end the tyranny that has oppressed them for 36 years, and the continued failure to do so constitutes ethically improper conduct by the international community.(28) For the past 36 years, the Cuban Government has posed and continues to pose a national security threat to the United States.(Pub.

Withholding of foreign assistance from countries supporting Juragua nuclear plant in Cuba(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) President Clinton stated in April 1993 that the United States opposed the construction of the Juragua nuclear power plant because of the concerns of the United States about Cuba\u2019s ability to ensure the safe operation of the facility and because of Cuba\u2019s refusal to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or ratify the Treaty of Tlatelolco.(2) Cuba has not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco, the latter of which establishes Latin America and the Caribbean as a nuclear weapons-free zone.(3) The State Department, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy have expressed concerns about the construction and operation of Cuba\u2019s nuclear reactors.(4) In a September 1992 report to the Congress, the General Accounting Office outlined concerns among nuclear energy experts about deficiencies in the nuclear plant project in Juragua, near Cienfuegos, Cuba, including\u2014(A) a lack in Cuba of a nuclear regulatory structure;(B) the absence in Cuba of an adequate infrastructure to ensure the plant\u2019s safe operation and requisite maintenance;(C) the inadequacy of training of plant operators;(D) reports by a former technician from Cuba who, by examining with x-rays weld sites believed to be part of the auxiliary plumbing system for the plant, found that 10 to 15 percent of those sites were defective;(E) since September 5, 1992(F) the possible inadequacy of the upper portion of ", "the reactors\u2019 dome retention capability to withstand only 7 pounds of pressure per square inch, given that normal atmospheric pressure is 32 pounds per square inch and United States reactors are designed to accommodate pressures of 50 pounds per square inch.(5) The United States Geological Survey claims that it had difficulty determining answers to specific questions regarding earthquake activity in the area near Cienfuegos because the Cuban Government was not forthcoming with information.(6) The Geological Survey has indicated that the Caribbean plate, a geological formation near the south coast of Cuba, may pose seismic risks to Cuba and the site of the power plant, and may produce large to moderate earthquakes.(7) On May 25, 1992(8) According to a study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, summer winds could carry radioactive pollutants from a nuclear accident at the power plant throughout all of Florida and parts of the States on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico as far as Texas, and northern winds could carry the pollutants as far northeast as Virginia and Washington, D.C.(9) The Cuban Government, under dictator Fidel Castro, in 1962 advocated the Soviets\u2019 launching of nuclear missiles to the United States, which represented a direct and dangerous provocation of the United States and brought the world to the brink of a nuclear conflict.(10) Fidel Castro over the years has consistently issued threats against the United States Government, most recently that he would unleash another perilous mass migration from Cuba upon the enactment of this chapter.(11) Despite the various concerns about the plant\u2019s safety and operational problems, a feasibility study is being conducted that would establish a support group to include Russia, Cuba, and third countries with the objective of completing and operating the plant.(b) Withholding of foreign assistance(1) In generalNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the President shall withhold from assistance allocated, on or after March 12, 1996March 12, 19", "96(2) ExceptionsThe requirement of paragraph (1) to withhold assistance shall not apply with respect to\u2014(A) assistance to meet urgent humanitarian needs, including disaster and refugee relief;(B) democratic political reform or rule of law activities;(C) the creation of private sector or nongovernmental organizations that are independent of government control;(D) the development of a free market economic system;(E) assistance for the purposes described in the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 (title XII of Public Law 103\u201316022 U.S.C. 5951(F) assistance under the secondary school exchange program administered by the United States Information Agency.(3) \u201cAssistance\u201d definedAs used in paragraph (1), the term \u201cassistance\u201d means assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 215122 U.S.C. 27517 U.S.C. 1701(Pub.

Condemnation of Cuban attack on American aircraft(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) Brothers to the Rescue is a Miami-based humanitarian organization engaged in searching for and aiding Cuban refugees in the Straits of Florida, and was engaged in such a mission on Saturday, February 24, 1996(2) The members of Brothers to the Rescue were flying unarmed and defenseless planes in a mission identical to hundreds they have flown since 1991 and posed no threat whatsoever to the Cuban Government, the Cuban military, or the Cuban people.(3) Statements by the Cuban Government that Brothers to the Rescue has engaged in covert operations, bombing campaigns, and commando operations against the Government of Cuba have no basis in fact.(4) The Brothers to the Rescue aircraft notified air traffic controllers as to their flight plans, which would take them south of the 24th parallel and close to Cuban airspace.(5) International law provides a nation with airspace over the 12-mile territorial sea.(6) The response of Fidel Castro\u2019s dictatorship to Saturday\u2019s afternoon flight was to scramble 2 fighter jets from a Havana airfield.(7) At approximately 3:24 p.m., the pilot of one of the Cuban MiGs received permission and proceeded to shoot down one Brothers to the Rescue airplane more than 6 miles north of the Cuban exclusion zone, or 18 miles from the Cuban coast.(8) Approximately 7 minutes later, the pilot of the Cuban fighter jet received permission and proceeded to shoot down the second Brothers to the Rescue airplane almost 18.5 miles north of the Cuban exclusion zone, or 30.5 miles from the Cuban coast.(9) The Cuban dictatorship, if it truly felt threatened by the flight of these unarmed aircraft, could have and should have pursued other peaceful options as requir", "ed by international law.(10) The response chosen by Fidel Castro, the use of lethal force, was completely inappropriate to the situation presented to the Cuban Government, making such actions a blatant and barbaric violation of international law and tantamount to cold-blooded murder.(11) There were no survivors of the attack on these aircraft, and the crew of a third aircraft managed to escape this criminal attack by Castro\u2019s Air Force.(12) The crew members of the destroyed planes, Pablo Morales, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Armando Alejandre, were United States citizens from Miami flying with Brothers to the Rescue on a voluntary basis.(13) It is incumbent upon the United States Government to protect the lives and livelihoods of United States citizens as well as the rights of free passage and humanitarian missions.(14) This premeditated act took place after a week-long wave of repression by the Cuban Government against Concilio Cubano, an umbrella organization of human rights activists, dissidents, independent economists, and independent journalists, among others.(15) The wave of repression against Concilio Cubano, whose membership is committed to peaceful democratic change in Cuba, included arrests, strip searches, house arrests, and in some cases sentences to more than 1 year in jail.(b) Statements by Congress(1) The Congress strongly condemns the act of terrorism by the Castro regime in shooting down the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft on February 24, 1996(2) The Congress extends its condolences to the families of Pablo Morales, Carlos Costa, Mario de la Pena, and Armando Alejandre, the victims of the attack.(3) The Congress urges the President to seek, in the International Court of Justice, indictment for this act of terrorism by Fidel Castro.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) Individuals enjoy a fundamental right to own and enjoy property which is enshrined in the United States Constitution.(2) The wrongful confiscation or taking of property belonging to United States nationals by the Cuban Government, and the subsequent exploitation of this property at the expense of the rightful owner, undermines the comity of nations, the free flow of commerce, and economic devel", "opment.(3) Since Fidel Castro seized power in Cuba in 1959\u2014(A) he has trampled on the fundamental rights of the Cuban people; and(B) through his personal despotism, he has confiscated the property of\u2014(i) millions of his own citizens;(ii) thousands of United States nationals; and(iii) thousands more Cubans who claimed asylum in the United States as refugees because of persecution and later became naturalized citizens of the United States.(4) It is in the interest of the Cuban people that the Cuban Government respect equally the property rights of Cuban nationals and nationals of other countries.(5) The Cuban Government is offering foreign investors the opportunity to purchase an equity interest in, manage, or enter into joint ventures using property and assets some of which were confiscated from United States nationals.(6) This \u201ctrafficking\u201d in confiscated property provides badly needed financial benefit, including hard currency, oil, and productive investment and expertise, to the current Cuban Government and thus undermines the foreign policy of the United States\u2014(A) to bring democratic institutions to Cuba through the pressure of a general economic embargo at a time when the Castro regime has proven to be vulnerable to international economic pressure; and(B) to protect the claims of United States nationals who had property wrongfully confiscated by the Cuban Government.(7) The United States Department of State has notified other governments that the transfer to third parties of properties confiscated by the Cuban Government \u201cwould complicate any attempt to return them to their original owners\u201d.(8) The international judicial system, as currently structured, lacks fully effective remedies for the wrongful confiscation of property and for unjust enrichment from the use of wrongfully confiscated property by governments and private entities at the expense of the rightful owners of the property.(9) International law recognizes that a nation has the ability to provide for rules of law with respect to conduct outside i", "ts territory that has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory.(10) The United States Government has an obligation to its citizens to provide protection against wrongful confiscations by foreign nations and their citizens, including the provision of private remedies.(11) To deter trafficking in wrongfully confiscated property, United States nationals who were the victims of these confiscations should be endowed with a judicial remedy in the courts of the United States that would deny traffickers any profits from economically exploiting Castro\u2019s wrongful seizures.(Pub.

Many of our Nation\u2019s founders fled religious persecution abroad, cherishing in their hearts and minds the ideal of religious freedom. They established in law, as a fundamental right and as a pillar of our Nation, the right to freedom of religion. From its birth to this day, the United States has prized this legacy of religious freedom and honored this heritage by standing for religious freedom and offering refuge to those suffering religious persecution.(2) Freedom of religious belief and practice is a universal human right and fundamental freedom articulated in numerous international instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Accords, the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the United Nations Charter, and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.(3) Article 18 of the Universal Declarat", "ion of Human Rights recognizes that \u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.\u201d. Article 18(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes that \u201cEveryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching\u201d. The freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is understood to protect theistic and non-theistic beliefs and the right not to profess or practice any religion. Governments have the responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of their citizens and to pursue justice for all. Religious freedom is a fundamental right of every individual, regardless of race, sex, country, creed, or nationality, and should never be arbitrarily abridged by any government.(4) The right to freedom of religion is under renewed and, in some cases, increasing assault in many countries around the world. More than one-half of the world\u2019s population lives under regimes that severely restrict or prohibit the freedom of their citizens to study, believe, observe, and freely practice the religious faith of their choice. Religious believers and communities suffer both government-sponsored and government-tolerated violations of their rights to religious freedom. Among the many forms of such violations are state-sponsored slander campaigns, confiscations of property, desecration of cemeteries, surveillance by security police, including by special divisions of \u201creligious police\u201d, severe prohibitions against construction and repair of places of worship, denial of the right to assemble and releg", "ation of religious communities to illegal status through arbitrary registration laws, prohibitions against the pursuit of education or public office, and prohibitions against publishing, distributing, or possessing religious literature and materials. A policy or practice of routinely denying applications for visas for religious workers in a country can be indicative of a poor state of religious freedom in that country.(5) Even more abhorrent, religious believers in many countries face such severe and violent forms of religious persecution as detention, torture, beatings, forced marriage, rape, imprisonment, enslavement, mass resettlement, and death merely for the peaceful belief in, change of or practice of their faith. In many countries, religious believers are forced to meet secretly, and religious leaders are targeted by national security forces and hostile mobs.(6) Though not confined to a particular region or regime, religious persecution and the specific targeting of non-theists, humanists, and atheists because of their beliefs is often particularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under totalitarian governments and in countries with militant, politicized religious majorities and in regions where non-state actors exercise significant political power and territorial control.(7) Congress has recognized and denounced acts of religious persecution through the adoption of the following resolutions:(A) House Resolution 515 of the One Hundred Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to the persecution of Christians worldwide.(B) Senate Concurrent Resolution 71 of the One Hundred Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding persecution of Christians worldwide.(C) House Concurrent Resolution 102 of the One Hundred Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives concerning the emancipation of the Iranian Baha\u2019i community.(b) Policy(1) In generalThe following shall be the policy of the United States:(A) To condemn violations of religio", "us freedom, and to promote, and to assist other governments in the promotion of, the fundamental right to freedom of religion.(B) To seek to channel United States security and development assistance to governments other than those found to be engaged in gross violations of the right to freedom of religion, as set forth in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151(C) To be vigorous and flexible, reflecting both the unwavering commitment of the United States to religious freedom and the desire of the United States for the most effective and principled response, in light of the range of violations of religious freedom by a variety of persecuting regimes, and the status of the relations of the United States with different nations.(D) To work with foreign governments that affirm and protect religious freedom, in order to develop multilateral documents and initiatives to combat violations of religious freedom and promote the right to religious freedom abroad.(E) Standing for liberty and standing with the persecuted, to use and implement appropriate tools in the United States foreign policy apparatus, including diplomatic, political, commercial, charitable, educational, and cultural channels, to promote respect for religious freedom by all governments and peoples.(2) Evolving policies and coordinated diplomatic responsesBecause the promotion of international religious freedom protects human rights, advances democracy abroad, and advances United States interests in stability, security, and development globally, the promotion of international religious freedom requires new and evolving policies and diplomatic responses that\u2014(A) are drawn from the expertise of the national security agencies, the diplomatic services, and other governmental agencies and nongovernmental organizations; and(B) are coordinated across and carried out by the entire range of Federal agencies.(Pub.

L. 115\u2013434, \u00a7\u202f2Jan. 14, 2019132 Stat. 5526\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) During the past decade, there has been a steady increase in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe, resulting in European Jews being the targets of physical and verbal harassment and even lethal terrorist attacks, all of which has eroded personal and communal security and the quality of daily Jewish life.\u201c(2) According to reporting by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), bet", "ween 2005 and 2014, anti-Semitic incidents increased in France from 508 to 851; in Germany from 60 to 173; in Belgium from 58 to 130; in Italy from 49 to 86; and in the United Kingdom from 459 to 1,168.\u201c(3) Anti-Zionism has at times devolved into anti-Semitic attacks, prompting condemnation from many European leaders, including French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\u201c(4) Since 2010, the Department of State has adhered to the working definition of Anti-Semitism by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC). Some contemporary examples of anti-Semitism include the following:\u201c(A) Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews (often in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion).\u201c(B) Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such, or the power of Jews as a collective, especially, but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government, or other societal institutions.\u201c(C) Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, the State of Israel, or even for acts committed by non-Jews.\u201c(D) Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust.\u201c(E) Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own countries.\u201c(5) On October 16, 2004section 2651 of this title\u201c(6) In November 2015, the House of Representatives passed H. Res. 354 by a vote of 418\u20130, urging the Secretary of State to continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism.\u201c(7) In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), comprised of 31 member countries, adopted a working definition of anti-Semitism which stated: \u2018Anti-Semit", "ism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\u2019.\u201c(8) The IHRA further clarified that manifestations of anti-Semitism might also target the State of Israel, conceived of as a Jewish collectivity. Anti-Semitism frequently charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for \u2018why things go wrong\u2019. It is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms, and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits.\u201d \u00a7\u202f6413.

Programs and allocations of funds by United States missions abroadIt is the sense of the Congress that\u2014(1) United States diplomatic missions in countries the governments of which engage in or tolerate violations of the internati", "onally recognized right to freedom of religion should develop, as part of annual program planning, a strategy to promote respect for the internationally recognized right to freedom of religion; and(2) in allocating or recommending the allocation of funds or the recommendation of candidates for programs and grants funded by the United States Government, United States diplomatic missions should give particular consideration to those programs and candidates deemed to assist in the promotion of the right to religious freedom.(Pub.

Findings and purposes(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) According to the Surgeon General of the United States, the epidemic of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) will soon become the worst epidemic of infectious disease in recorded history, eclipsing both the bu", "bonic plague of the 1300\u2019s and the influenza epidemic of 1918\u20131919 which killed more than 20,000,000 people worldwide.(2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 34,300,000 people in the world today are living with HIV/AIDS, of which approximately 95 percent live in the developing world.(3) UNAIDS data shows that among children age 14 and under worldwide, more than 3,800,000 have died from AIDS, more than 1,300,000 are living with the disease; and in 1 year alone\u20141999\u2014an estimated 620,000 became infected, of which over 90 percent were babies born to HIV-positive women.(4) Although sub-Saharan Africa has only 10 percent of the world\u2019s population, it is home to more than 24,500,000\u2014roughly 70 percent\u2014of the world\u2019s HIV/AIDS cases.(5) Worldwide, there have already been an estimated 18,800,000 deaths because of HIV/AIDS, of which more than 80 percent occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.(6) The gap between rich and poor countries in terms of transmission of HIV from mother to child has been increasing. Moreover, AIDS threatens to reverse years of steady progress of child survival in developing countries. UNAIDS believes that by the year 2010, AIDS may have increased mortality of children under 5 years of age by more than 100 percent in regions most affected by the virus.(7) According to UNAIDS, by the end of 1999, 13,200,000 children have lost at least one parent to AIDS, including 12,100,000 children in sub-Saharan Africa, and are thus considered AIDS orphans.(8) At current infection and growth rates for HIV/AIDS, the National Intelligence Council estimates that the number of AIDS orphans worldwide will increase dramatically, potentially increasing threefold or more in the next 10 years, contributing to economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in already volatile and strained societies. Children without care or hope are often drawn into prostitution, crime, substance abuse, or child soldiery.(9) Donors must focus on adequate preparations for the explosion ", "in the number of orphans and the burden they will place on families, communities, economies, and governments. Support structures and incentives for families, communities, and institutions which will provide care for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, or for the children who are themselves afflicted by HIV/AIDS, will be essential.(10) The 1999 annual report by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) states \u201c[t]he number of orphans, particularly in Africa, constitutes nothing less than an emergency, requiring an emergency response\u201d and that \u201cfinding the resources needed to help stabilize the crisis and protect children is a priority that requires urgent action from the international community.\u201d.(11) The discovery of a relatively simple and inexpensive means of interrupting the transmission of HIV from an infected mother to the unborn child\u2014namely with nevirapine (NVP), which costs US$4 a tablet\u2014has created a great opportunity for an unprecedented partnership between the United States Government and the governments of Asian, African and Latin American countries to reduce mother-to-child transmission (also known as \u201cvertical transmission\u201d) of HIV.(12) According to UNAIDS, if implemented this strategy will decrease the proportion of orphans that are HIV-infected and decrease infant and child mortality rates in these developing regions.(13) A mother-to-child antiretroviral drug strategy can be a force for social change, providing the opportunity and impetus needed to address often long-standing problems of inadequate services and the profound stigma associated with HIV-infection and the AIDS disease. Strengthening the health infrastructure to improve mother-and-child health, antenatal, delivery and postnatal services, and couples counseling generates enormous spillover effects toward combating the AIDS epidemic in developing regions.(14) United States Census Bureau statistics show life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa falling to around 30 years of age within a decade, the lowest in a century, and project life expectanc", "y in 2010 to be 29 years of age in Botswana, 30 years of age in Swaziland, 33 years of age in Namibia and Zimbabwe, and 36 years of age in South Africa, Malawi, and Rwanda, in contrast to a life expectancy of 70 years of age in many of the countries without a high prevalence of AIDS.(15) A January 2000 United States National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) report on the global infectious disease threat concluded that the economic costs of infectious diseases\u2014especially HIV/AIDS\u2014are already significant and could reduce GDP by as much as 20 percent or more by 2010 in some sub-Saharan African nations.(16) According to the same NIE report, HIV prevalence among militias in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are estimated at 40 to 60 percent, and at 15 to 30 percent in Tanzania.(17) The HIV/AIDS epidemic is of increasing concern in other regions of the world, with UNAIDS estimating that there are more than 5,600,000 cases in South and South-east Asia, that the rate of HIV infection in the Caribbean is second only to sub-Saharan Africa, and that HIV infections have doubled in just 2 years in the former Soviet Union.(18) Despite the discouraging statistics on the spread of HIV/AIDS, some developing nations\u2014such as Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand\u2014have implemented prevention programs that have substantially curbed the rate of HIV infection.(19) AIDS, like all diseases, knows no national boundaries, and there is no certitude that the scale of the problem in one continent can be contained within that region.(20) Accordingly, United States financial support for medical research, education, and disease containment as a global strategy has beneficial ramifications for millions of Americans and their families who are affected by this disease, and the entire population which is potentially susceptible.(b) PurposesThe purposes of this chapter are to\u2014(1) help prevent human suffering through the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV/AIDS; and(2) help ensure the viability of economic development, stability, and national ", "security in the developing world by advancing research to\u2014(A) understand the causes associated with HIV/AIDS in developing countries; and(B) assist in the development of an AIDS vaccine.(Pub.

Coordinated donor strategy for support and education of orphans in sub-Saharan Africa(a) Statement of policyIt is in the national interest of the United States to assist in mitigating the burden that will be placed on sub-Saharan African social, economic, and political institutions as these institutions struggle with the consequences of a dramatically increasing AIDS orphan population, many of whom are themselves infected by HIV and living with AIDS. Effectively addressing that burden and its consequences in sub-Saharan Africa will require a coordinated multidonor strategy.(b) Development of strategyThe President shall coordinate the development of a multidonor strategy to provide for the support and education of AIDS orphans and the families, communities, and institutions most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.(c) DefinitionIn this section, the term \u201cHIV/AIDS\u201d means, with respect to an individual, an individual who is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), or living with AIDS.(Pub.

African crisis response initiative and HIV/AIDS training(a) FindingsCongress finds that\u2014(1) the spread of HIV/AIDS constitutes a threat to security in Africa;(2) civil unrest and war may contribute to the spread of the disease to different parts of the continent;(3) the percentage of soldiers in African militaries who are infected with HIV/AIDS is unknown, but estimates range in some countries as high as 40 percent; and(4) it is in the interests of the United States to assist the countries of Africa in combating the spread of HIV/AIDS.(b) Education on the prevention of the spread of AIDSIn undertaking education and traini", "ng programs for military establishments in African countries, the United States shall ensure that classroom training under the African Crisis Response Initiative includes military-based education on the prevention of the spread of AIDS.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) In 1980, the United States opened trade relations with the People\u2019s Republic of China by entering into a bilateral trade agreement, which was approved by joint resolution enacted pursuant to section 2435(c) of title 19(2) Since 1980, the President has consistently extended nondiscriminatory treatment to products of the People\u2019s Republic of China, pursuant to his authority under section 2434 of title 19(3) Since 1980, the United States has entered into several additional trade-related agreements with the People\u2019s Republic of China, including a memorandum of understanding on market access in 1992, two agreements on intellectual property rights protection in 1992 and 1995, and an agreement on agricultural cooperation in 1999.(4) Trade in goods between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the United States totaled almost $95,000,000,000 in 1999, compared with approximately $18,000,000,000 in 1989, representing growth of approximately 428 percent over 10 years.(5) The United States merchandise trade deficit with the People\u2019s Republic of China has grown from approximately $6,000,000,000 in 1989 to over $68,000,000,000 in 1999, a growth of over 1,000 percent.(6) The People\u2019s Republic of China currently restricts imports through relatively high tariffs and nontariff barriers, including import licensing, technology transfer, and local content requirements.(7) United States businesses attempting to sell go", "ods to markets in the People\u2019s Republic of China have complained of uneven application of tariffs, customs procedures, and other laws, rules, and administrative measures affecting their ability to sell their products in the Chinese market.(8) On November 15, 1999(9) The commitments that the People\u2019s Republic of China made in its November 15, 1999(10) The record of the People\u2019s Republic of China in implementing trade-related commitments has been mixed. While the People\u2019s Republic of China has generally met the requirements of the 1992 market access memorandum of understanding and the 1992 and 1995 agreements on intellectual property rights protection, other measures remain in place or have been put into place which tend to diminish the benefit to United States businesses, farmers, and workers from the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s implementation of those earlier commitments. Notably, administration of tariff-rate quotas and other trade-related laws remains opaque, new local content requirements have proliferated, restrictions on importation of animal and plant products are not always supported by sound science, and licensing requirements for importation and distribution of goods remain common. Finally, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China has failed to cooperate with the United States Customs Service in implementing a 1992 memorandum of understanding prohibiting trade in products made by prison labor.(11) The human rights record of the People\u2019s Republic of China is a matter of very serious concern to the Congress. The Congress notes that the Department of State\u2019s 1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for the People\u2019s Republic of China finds that \u201c[t]he Government\u2019s poor human rights record deteriorated markedly throughout the year, as the Government intensified efforts to suppress dissent, particularly organized dissent.\u201d.(12) The Congress deplores violations by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China of human rights, religious freedoms, and worker rights that are referred to in the De", "partment of State\u2019s 1999 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for the People\u2019s Republic of China, including the banning of the Falun Gong spiritual movement, denial in many cases, particularly politically sensitive ones, of effective representation by counsel and public trials, extrajudicial killings and torture, forced abortion and sterilization, restriction of access to Tibet and Xinjiang, perpetuation of \u201creeducation through labor\u201d, denial of the right of workers to organize labor unions or bargain collectively with their employers, and failure to implement a 1992 memorandum of understanding prohibiting trade in products made by prison labor.(Pub.

Purposes and findings(a) PurposesThe purposes of this chapter are to combat trafficking in persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children, to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers, and to protect their victims.(b) FindingsCongress finds that:(1) As the 21st century begins, the degrading institution of slavery continues throughout the world. Trafficking in persons is a modern form of slavery, and it is the largest manifestation of slavery today. At least 700,000 persons annually, primarily women and children, are trafficked within or across international borders. Approximately 50,000 women and children are trafficked into the United States each year.(2) Many of these persons are trafficked into the international sex trade, often by force, fraud, or coercion. The sex industry has rapidly expanded over the past several decades. It involves sexual exploitation of persons, predominantly women and girls, involving activities related to prostitution, pornography, sex tourism, and other commercial sexual services. The low status of women in many parts of the world has contributed to a burgeoning of the trafficking industry.(3) Trafficking in persons is not limited to the sex industry. This growing transnational crime also includes forced labor and involves significant violations of labor, public health, and human rights standards worldwide.(4) Traffickers primarily target women and girls, who are disproportionately affected by poverty, the lack of access to education, chronic unemployment, discrimination, and the lack of economic opportunities in countries of origi", "n. Traffickers lure women and girls into their networks through false promises of decent working conditions at relatively good pay as nannies, maids, dancers, factory workers, restaurant workers, sales clerks, or models. Traffickers also buy children from poor families and sell them into prostitution or into various types of forced or bonded labor.(5) Traffickers often transport victims from their home communities to unfamiliar destinations, including foreign countries away from family and friends, religious institutions, and other sources of protection and support, leaving the victims defenseless and vulnerable.(6) Victims are often forced through physical violence to engage in sex acts or perform slavery-like labor. Such force includes rape and other forms of sexual abuse, torture, starvation, imprisonment, threats, psychological abuse, and coercion.(7) Traffickers often make representations to their victims that physical harm may occur to them or others should the victim escape or attempt to escape. Such representations can have the same coercive effects on victims as direct threats to inflict such harm.(8) Trafficking in persons is increasingly perpetrated by organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises. Such trafficking is the fastest growing source of profits for organized criminal enterprises worldwide. Profits from the trafficking industry contribute to the expansion of organized crime in the United States and worldwide. Trafficking in persons is often aided by official corruption in countries of origin, transit, and destination, thereby threatening the rule of law.(9) Trafficking includes all the elements of the crime of forcible rape when it involves the involuntary participation of another person in sex acts by means of fraud, force, or coercion.(10) Trafficking also involves violations of other laws, including labor and immigration codes and laws against kidnapping, slavery, false imprisonment, assault, battery, pandering, fraud, and extortion.(11) Trafficking exposes victims to serious health risks.", " Women and children trafficked in the sex industry are exposed to deadly diseases, including HIV and AIDS. Trafficking victims are sometimes worked or physically brutalized to death.(12) Trafficking in persons substantially affects interstate and foreign commerce. Trafficking for such purposes as involuntary servitude, peonage, and other forms of forced labor has an impact on the nationwide employment network and labor market. Within the context of slavery, servitude, and labor or services which are obtained or maintained through coercive conduct that amounts to a condition of servitude, victims are subjected to a range of violations.(13) Involuntary servitude statutes are intended to reach cases in which persons are held in a condition of servitude through nonviolent coercion. In United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988), the Supreme Court found that section 1584 of title 18(14) Existing legislation and law enforcement in the United States and other countries are inadequate to deter trafficking and bring traffickers to justice, failing to reflect the gravity of the offenses involved. No comprehensive law exists in the United States that penalizes the range of offenses involved in the trafficking scheme. Instead, even the most brutal instances of trafficking in the sex industry are often punished under laws that also apply to lesser offenses, so that traffickers typically escape deserved punishment.(15) In the United States, the seriousness of this crime and its components is not reflected in current sentencing guidelines, resulting in weak penalties for convicted traffickers.(16) In some countries, enforcement against traffickers is also hindered by official indifference, by corruption, and sometimes even by official participation in trafficking.(17) Existing laws often fail to protect victims of trafficking, and because victims are often illegal immigrants in the destination country, they are repeatedly punished more harshly than the traffickers themselves.(18) Additionally, adequate services and faciliti", "es do not exist to meet victims\u2019 needs regarding health care, housing, education, and legal assistance, which safely reintegrate trafficking victims into their home countries.(19) Victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, such as using false documents, entering the country without documentation, or working without documentation.(20) Because victims of trafficking are frequently unfamiliar with the laws, cultures, and languages of the countries into which they have been trafficked, because they are often subjected to coercion and intimidation including physical detention and debt bondage, and because they often fear retribution and forcible removal to countries in which they will face retribution or other hardship, these victims often find it difficult or impossible to report the crimes committed against them or to assist in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes.(21) Trafficking of persons is an evil requiring concerted and vigorous action by countries of origin, transit or destination, and by international organizations.(22) One of the founding documents of the United States, the Declaration of Independence, recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of all people. It states that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. The right to be free from slavery and involuntary servitude is among those unalienable rights. Acknowledging this fact, the United States outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude in 1865, recognizing them as evil institutions that must be abolished. Current practices of sexual slavery and trafficking of women and children are similarly abhorrent to the principles upon which the United States was founded.(23) The United States and the international community agree that trafficking in persons involves grave violations of human rights and is a matter of pressing international concern. ", "The international community has repeatedly condemned slavery and involuntary servitude, violence against women, and other elements of trafficking, through declarations, treaties, and United Nations resolutions and reports, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery; the 1948 American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man; the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; United Nations General Assembly Resolutions 50/167, 51/66, and 52/98; the Final Report of the World Congress against Sexual Exploitation of Children (Stockholm, 1996); the Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995); and the 1991 Moscow Document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.(24) Trafficking in persons is a transnational crime with national implications. To deter international trafficking and bring its perpetrators to justice, nations including the United States must recognize that trafficking is a serious offense. This is done by prescribing appropriate punishment, giving priority to the prosecution of trafficking offenses, and protecting rather than punishing the victims of such offenses. The United States must work bilaterally and multilaterally to abolish the trafficking industry by taking steps to promote cooperation among countries linked together by international trafficking routes.

L. 109\u2013164, \u00a7\u202f2Jan. 10, 2006119 Stat. 3558\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) The United States has demonstrated international leadership in combating human trafficking and slavery through the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (division A of Public Law 106\u201338622 U.S.C. 7101Public Law 108\u2013193\u201c(2) The United States Government currently estimates that 600,000 to 800,000 individuals are trafficked across international borders each year and exploited through forced labor and commercial sex exploitation. An estimated 80 percent of such individuals are women and girls.\u201c(3) Since the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 [Oct. 28, 2000\u201c(4) Trafficking in persons also occurs within the borders of a country, including the United States.\u201c(5) No known studies exist that quantify the problem of trafficking in children for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation in the United States. Accordi", "ng to a report issued by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001, as many as 300,000 children in the United States are at risk for commercial sexual exploitation, including trafficking, at any given time.\u201c(6) Runaway and homeless children in the United States are highly susceptible to being domestically trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation. According to the National Runaway Switchboard, every day in the United States, between 1,300,000 and 2,800,000 runaway and homeless youth live on the streets. One out of every seven children will run away from home before the age of 18.\u201c(7) Following armed conflicts and during humanitarian emergencies, indigenous populations face increased security challenges and vulnerabilities which result in myriad forms of violence, including trafficking for sexual and labor exploitation. Foreign policy and foreign aid professionals increasingly recognize the increased activity of human traffickers in post-conflict settings and during humanitarian emergencies.\u201c(8) There is a need to protect populations in post-conflict settings and humanitarian emergencies from being trafficked for sexual or labor exploitation. The efforts of aid agencies to address the protection needs of, among others, internally displaced persons and refugees are useful in this regard. Nonetheless, there is a need for further integrated programs and strategies at the United States Agency for International Development, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense to combat human trafficking, including through protection and prevention methodologies, in post-conflict environments and during humanitarian emergencies.\u201c(9) International and human rights organizations have documented a correlation between international deployments of military and civilian peacekeepers and aid workers and a resulting increase in the number of women and girls trafficked into prostitution in post-conflict regions.\u201c(10) The involvement of employees and contractors of the United States Government and members of the", " Armed Forces in trafficking in persons, facilitating the trafficking in persons, or exploiting the victims of trafficking in persons is inconsistent with United States laws and policies and undermines the credibility and mission of United States Government programs in post-conflict regions.\u201c(11) Further measures are needed to ensure that United States Government personnel and contractors are held accountable for involvement with acts of trafficking in persons, including by expanding United States criminal jurisdiction to all United States Government contractors abroad.\u201dPub.

Minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking(a) Minimum standardsFor purposes of this chapter, the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking applicable to the government of a country of origin, transit, or destination for victims of severe forms of trafficking are the following:(1) The government of the country should prohibit severe forms of trafficking in persons and punish acts of such trafficking.(2) For the knowing commission of any act of sex trafficking involving force, fraud, coercion, or in which the victim of sex trafficking is a child incapable of giving meaningful consent, or of trafficking which includes rape or kidnapping or which causes a death, the government of the country should prescribe punishment commensurate with that for grave crimes, such as forcible sexual assault.(3) For the knowing commission of any act of a severe form of trafficking in persons, the government of the country should prescribe punishment that is sufficiently stringent to deter and that adequately reflects the heinous nature of the offense.(4) The government of the country should make serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons.(b) CriteriaIn determinations under subsection (a)(4), the following factors should be considered as indicia of serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons:(1) Whether the government of the country vigorously investigates and prosecutes acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons, and convicts and se", "ntences persons responsible for such acts, that take place wholly or partly within the territory of the country, including, as appropriate, requiring incarceration of individuals convicted of such acts. For purposes of the preceding sentence, suspended or significantly-reduced sentences for convictions of principal actors in cases of severe forms of trafficking in persons shall be considered, on a case-by-case basis, whether to be considered an indicator of serious and sustained efforts to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons. After reasonable requests from the Department of State for data regarding investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and sentences, a government which does not provide such data, consistent with a demonstrably increasing capacity of such government to obtain such data, shall be presumed not to have vigorously investigated, prosecuted, convicted or sentenced such acts.(2) Whether the government of the country protects victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and encourages their assistance in the investigation and prosecution of such trafficking, including provisions for legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they would face retribution or hardship, and ensures that victims are not inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized solely for unlawful acts as a direct result of being trafficked, including by providing training to law enforcement and immigration officials regarding the identification and treatment of trafficking victims using approaches that focus on the needs of the victims.(3) Whether the government of the country has adopted measures to prevent severe forms of trafficking in persons, such as measures to inform and educate the public, including potential victims, about the causes and consequences of severe forms of trafficking in persons, measures to establish the identity of local populations, including birth registration, citizenship, and nationality, measures to ensure that its nationals who are deployed abroad as part of ", "a diplomatic, peacekeeping, or other similar mission do not engage in or facilitate severe forms of trafficking in persons or exploit victims of such trafficking, a transparent system for remediating or punishing such public officials as a deterrent, measures to prevent the use of forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards, effective bilateral, multilateral, or regional information sharing and cooperation arrangements with other countries, and effective policies or laws regulating foreign labor recruiters and holding them civilly and criminally liable for fraudulent recruiting.(4) Whether the government of the country cooperates with other governments in the investigation and prosecution of severe forms of trafficking in persons and has entered into bilateral, multilateral, or regional law enforcement cooperation and coordination arrangements with other countries.(5) Whether the government of the country extradites persons charged with acts of severe forms of trafficking in persons on substantially the same terms and to substantially the same extent as persons charged with other serious crimes (or, to the extent such extradition would be inconsistent with the laws of such country or with international agreements to which the country is a party, whether the government is taking all appropriate measures to modify or replace such laws and treaties so as to permit such extradition).(6) Whether the government of the country monitors immigration and emigration patterns for evidence of severe forms of trafficking in persons and whether law enforcement agencies of the country respond to any such evidence in a manner that is consistent with the vigorous investigation and prosecution of acts of such trafficking, as well as with the protection of human rights of victims and the internationally recognized human right to leave any country, including one\u2019s own, and to return to one\u2019s own country.(7) Whether the government of the country vigorously investigates, prosecutes, convicts, and sentences publi", "c officials, including diplomats and soldiers, who participate in or facilitate severe forms of trafficking in persons, including nationals of the country who are deployed abroad as part of a diplomatic, peacekeeping, or other similar mission who engage in or facilitate severe forms of trafficking in persons or exploit victims of such trafficking, and takes all appropriate measures against officials who condone or enable such trafficking. A government\u2019s failure to appropriately address public allegations against such public officials, especially once such officials have returned to their home countries, shall be considered inaction under these criteria. After reasonable requests from the Department of State for data regarding such investigations, prosecutions, convictions, and sentences, a government which does not provide such data, consistent with a demonstrably increasing capacity of such government to obtain such data, shall be presumed not to have vigorously investigated, prosecuted, convicted, or sentenced such acts.(8) Whether the percentage of victims of severe forms of trafficking in the country that are non-citizens of such countries is insignificant.(9) Whether the government has entered into effective, transparent partnerships, cooperative arrangements, or agreements that have resulted in concrete and measurable outcomes with\u2014(A) domestic civil society organizations, private sector entities, or international nongovernmental organizations, or into multilateral or regional arrangements or agreements, to assist the government\u2019s efforts to prevent trafficking, protect victims, and punish traffickers; or(B) the United States toward agreed goals and objectives in the collective fight against trafficking.(10) Whether the government of the country, consistent with the capacity of such government, systematically monitors its efforts to satisfy the criteria described in paragraphs (1) through (8) and makes available publicly a periodic assessment of such efforts.(11) Whether the government of the country achiev", "es appreciable progress in eliminating severe forms of trafficking when compared to the assessment in the previous year.(12) Whether the government of the country has made serious and sustained efforts to reduce the demand for\u2014(A) commercial sex acts; and(B) participation in international sex tourism by nationals of the country.(Pub.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) On July 17, 1998(2) As of April 30, 2001(3) Since ", "adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory Commission for the International Criminal Court has met regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.(4) During testimony before the Congress following the adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not been achieved. As a result, he stated: \u201cWe are left with consequences that do not serve the cause of international justice.\u201d.(5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \u201cMultinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court\u2019s jurisdiction even if the country of the individual peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably prosecuted by the international court even if the United States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in multinational operations, including humanitarian interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.\u201d.(6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on December 31, 2000(7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural protections to which all Americans are entitled under the Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the right to trial by jury.(8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should be free from the risk of prosecution by the International Criminal Cour", "t, especially when they are stationed or deployed around the world to protect the vital national interests of the United States. The United States Government has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions carried out by the International Criminal Court.(9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of the United States to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior elected and appointed officials of the United States Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression over United States objections, senior United States officials may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of the United States Government should be free from the risk of prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the national interests of the United States.(10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \u201cdetermine the existence of any .\u2000\u2026 act of aggression\u201d would contravene the charter of the United Nations and undermine deterrence.(11) It is a fundamental principle of international law that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it does not create obligations for nonparties without their consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Criminal C", "ourt over United States nationals.(Pub.

The Taliban restrictions on Afghan women\u2019s freedom of expression, association, and movement deny women full participation in society and, consequently, from effectively securing basic access to work, education, and health care.\u201c(2) Afghanistan has one of the highest infant (165 of 1000) and child (257 of 1000) mortality rates in the world.\u201c(3) Only 5 percent of rural and 39 percent of urban Afghans have access to safe drinking water.\u201c(4) It is estimated that 42 percent of all deaths in Afghanistan are due to diarrheal diseases caused by contaminated food and w", "ater.\u201c(5) Over one-third of Afghan children under 5 years of age suffer from malnutrition, 85,000 of whom die annually.\u201c(6) Seventy percent of the health care system in Afghanistan is dependent on foreign assistance.\u201c(7) As of May 1998, only 20 percent of hospital medical and surgical beds dedicated to adults were available for women, and thousands of Afghan women and girls are routinely denied health care.\u201c(8) Women are forbidden to leave their homes without being escorted by a male relative. This prevents many women from seeking basic necessities like health care and food for their children. Doctors, virtually all of whom are male, are also not permitted to provide certain types of care not deemed appropriate by the Taliban.\u201c(9) Before the Taliban took control of Kabul, schools were coeducational, with women accounting for 70 percent of the teaching force.

Today, the Taliban prohibits women from working as teachers, doctors, and in any other occupation.\u201c(10) The Taliban prohibit [sic] girls and women from attending school.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) During the last 20 years, HIV/AIDS has assumed pandemic proportions, spreading from the most severely affected regions, sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, to all corners of the world, and leaving an unprecedented path of death and devastation.(2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 65,000,000 individuals worldwide have been infected with HIV since the epidemic began, more than 25,000,000 of these individuals have lost their lives to the disease, and mor", "e than 14,000,000 children have been orphaned by the disease. HIV/AIDS is the fourth-highest cause of death in the world.(3)(A) At the end of 2002, an estimated 42,000,000 individuals were infected with HIV or living with AIDS, of which more than 75 percent live in Africa or the Caribbean. Of these individuals, more than 3,200,000 were children under the age of 15 and more than 19,200,000 were women.(B) Women are four times more vulnerable to infection than are men and are becoming infected at increasingly high rates, in part because many societies do not provide poor women and young girls with the social, legal, and cultural protections against high risk activities that expose them to HIV/AIDS.(C) Women and children who are refugees or are internally displaced persons are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and violence, thereby increasing the possibility of HIV infection.(4) As the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS has killed more than 19,400,000 individuals (more than 3 times the number of AIDS deaths in the rest of the world) and will claim the lives of one-quarter of the population, mostly adults, in the next decade.(5) An estimated 2,000,000 individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean and another 7,100,000 individuals in Asia and the Pacific region are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. Infection rates are rising alarmingly in Eastern Europe (especially in the Russian Federation), Central Asia, and China.(6) HIV/AIDS threatens personal security by affecting the health, lifespan, and productive capacity of the individual and the social cohesion and economic well-being of the family.(7) HIV/AIDS undermines the economic security of a country and individual businesses in that country by weakening the productivity and longevity of the labor force across a broad array of economic sectors and by reducing the potential for economic growth over the long term.(8) HIV/AIDS destabilizes communities by striking at the most mobile and educated members of society, many of whom are responsi", "ble for security at the local level and governance at the national and subnational levels as well as many teachers, health care personnel, and other community workers vital to community development and the effort to combat HIV/AIDS. In some countries the overwhelming challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are accelerating the outward migration of critically important health care professionals.(9) HIV/AIDS weakens the defenses of countries severely affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis through high infection rates among members of their military forces and voluntary peacekeeping personnel. According to UNAIDS, in sub-Saharan Africa, many military forces have infection rates as much as five times that of the civilian population.(10) HIV/AIDS poses a serious security issue for the international community by\u2014(A) increasing the potential for political instability and economic devastation, particularly in those countries and regions most severely affected by the disease;(B) decreasing the capacity to resolve conflicts through the introduction of peacekeeping forces because the environments into which these forces are introduced pose a high risk for the spread of HIV/AIDS; and(C) increasing the vulnerability of local populations to HIV/AIDS in conflict zones from peacekeeping troops with HIV infection rates significantly higher than civilian populations.(11) The devastation wrought by the HIV/AIDS pandemic is compounded by the prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria, particularly in developing countries where the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, including women, children, and those individuals living with HIV/AIDS, become infected. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria accounted for more than 5,700,000 deaths in 2001 and caused debilitating illnesses in millions more.(12) Together, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and related diseases are undermining agricultural production throughout Africa. According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, 7,000,000", " agricultural workers throughout 25 African countries have died from AIDS since 1985. Countries with poorly developed agricultural systems, which already face chronic food shortages, are the hardest hit, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where high HIV prevalence rates are compounding the risk of starvation for an estimated 14,400,000 people.(13) Tuberculosis is the cause of death for one out of every three people with AIDS worldwide and is a highly communicable disease. HIV infection is the leading threat to tuberculosis control. Because HIV infection so severely weakens the immune system, individuals with HIV and latent tuberculosis infection have a 100 times greater risk of developing active tuberculosis diseases thereby increasing the risk of spreading tuberculosis to others. Tuberculosis, in turn, accelerates the onset of AIDS in individuals infected with HIV.(14) Malaria, the most deadly of all tropical parasitic diseases, has been undergoing a dramatic resurgence in recent years due to increasing resistance of the malaria parasite to inexpensive and effective drugs. At the same time, increasing resistance of mosquitoes to standard insecticides makes control of transmission difficult to achieve. The World Health Organization estimates that between 300,000,000 and 500,000,000 new cases of malaria occur each year, and annual deaths from the disease number between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000. Persons infected with HIV are particularly vulnerable to the malaria parasite. The spread of HIV infection contributes to the difficulties of controlling resurgence of the drug resistant malaria parasite.(15) HIV/AIDS is first and foremost a health problem. Successful strategies to stem the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic will require clinical medical interventions, the strengthening of health care delivery systems and infrastructure, and determined national leadership and increased budgetary allocations for the health sector in countries affected by the epidemic as well as measures to address the social and behavioral caus", "es of the problem and its impact on families, communities, and societal sectors.(16) Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections and to bring care and treatment to people living with AIDS, such as voluntary counseling and testing and mother-to-child transmission programs, are achieving meaningful results and are cost-effective. The challenge is to expand these interventions from a pilot program basis to a national basis in a coherent and sustainable manner.(17) Appropriate treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS can prolong the lives of such individuals, preserve their families, prevent children from becoming orphans, and increase productivity of such individuals by allowing them to lead active lives and reduce the need for costly hospitalization for treatment of opportunistic infections caused by HIV.(18) Nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based organizations, with experience in health care and HIV/AIDS counseling, have proven effective in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic and can be a resource in assisting indigenous organizations in severely affected countries in their efforts to provide treatment and care for individuals infected with HIV/AIDS.(19) Faith-based organizations are making an important contribution to HIV prevention and AIDS treatment programs around the world. Successful HIV prevention programs in Uganda, Jamaica, and elsewhere have included local churches and faith-based groups in efforts to promote behavior changes to prevent HIV, to reduce stigma associated with HIV infection, to treat those afflicted with the disease, and to care for orphans. The Catholic Church alone currently cares for one in four people being treated for AIDS worldwide. Faith-based organizations possess infrastructure, experience, and knowledge that will be needed to carry out these programs in the future and should be an integral part of United States efforts.(20)(A) Uganda has experienced the most significant decline in HIV rates of any country in Africa, including a decrease among pregnant women from 20.6", " percent in 1991 to 7.9 percent in 2000.(B) Uganda made this remarkable turnaround because President Yoweri Museveni spoke out early, breaking long-standing cultural taboos, and changed widespread perceptions about the disease. His leadership stands as a model for ways political leaders in Africa and other developing countries can mobilize their nations, including civic organizations, professional associations, religious institutions, business and labor to combat HIV/AIDS.(C) Uganda\u2019s successful AIDS treatment and prevention program is referred to as the ABC model: \u201cAbstain, Be faithful, use Condoms\u201d, in order of priority. Jamaica, Zambia, Ethiopia and Senegal have also successfully used the ABC model. Beginning in 1986, Uganda brought about a fundamental change in sexual behavior by developing a low-cost program with the message: \u201cStop having multiple partners. Be faithful. Teenagers, wait until you are married before you begin sex.\u201d.(D) By 1995, 95 percent of Ugandans were reporting either one or zero sexual partners in the past year, and the proportion of sexually active youth declined significantly from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The greatest percentage decline in HIV infections and the greatest degree of behavioral change occurred in those 15 to 19 years old. Uganda\u2019s success shows that behavior change, through the use of the ABC model, is a very successful way to prevent the spread of HIV.(21) The magnitude and scope of the HIV/AIDS crisis demands a comprehensive, long-term, international response focused upon addressing the causes, reducing the spread, and ameliorating the consequences of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including\u2014(A) prevention and education, care and treatment, basic and applied research, and training of health care workers, particularly at the community and provincial levels, and other community workers and leaders needed to cope with the range of consequences of the HIV/AIDS crisis;(B) development of health care infrastructure and delivery systems through cooperative and coordinated public", " efforts and public and private partnerships;(C) development and implementation of national and community-based multisector strategies that address the impact of HIV/AIDS on the individual, family, community, and nation and increase the participation of at-risk populations in programs designed to encourage behavioral and social change and reduce the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS; and(D) coordination of efforts between international organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO), national governments, and private sector organizations, including faith-based organizations.(22) The United States has the capacity to lead and enhance the effectiveness of the international community\u2019s response by\u2014(A) providing substantial financial resources, technical expertise, and training, particularly of health care personnel and community workers and leaders;(B) promoting vaccine and microbicide research and the development of new treatment protocols in the public and commercial pharmaceutical research sectors;(C) making available pharmaceuticals and diagnostics for HIV/AIDS therapy;(D) encouraging governments and faith-based and community-based organizations to adopt policies that treat HIV/AIDS as a multisectoral public health problem affecting not only health but other areas such as agriculture, education, the economy, the family and society, and assisting them to develop and implement programs corresponding to these needs;(E) promoting healthy lifestyles, including abstinence, delaying sexual debut, monogamy, marriage, faithfulness, use of condoms, and avoiding substance abuse; and(F) encouraging active involvement of the private sector, including businesses, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the medical and scientific communities, charitable foundations, private and voluntary organizations and nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations, community-based organizations, and other ", "nonprofit entities.(23) Prostitution and other sexual victimization are degrading to women and children and it should be the policy of the United States to eradicate such practices. The sex industry, the trafficking of individuals into such industry, and sexual violence are additional causes of and factors in the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One in nine South Africans is living with AIDS, and sexual assault is rampant, at a victimization rate of one in three women. Meanwhile in Cambodia, as many as 40 percent of prostitutes are infected with HIV and the country has the highest rate of increase of HIV infection in all of Southeast Asia. Victims of coercive sexual encounters do not get to make choices about their sexual activities.(24) Strong coordination must exist among the various agencies of the United States to ensure effective and efficient use of financial and technical resources within the United States Government with respect to the provision of international HIV/AIDS assistance.(25) In his address to Congress on January 28, 2003(26) In this address to Congress, the President stated the following: \u201cToday, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30,000,000 people have the AIDS virus\u2014including 3,000,000 children under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4,000,000 require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims\u2014only 50,000\u2014are receiving the medicine they need.\u201d.(27) Furthermore, the President focused on care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in his address to Congress, stating the following: \u201cBecause the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, \u2018We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you\u2019ve got AIDS, we can\u2019t help you. Go home and die.\u2019 In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti", "-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years *\u2000*\u2000* Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.\u201d.(28) Finally, the President stated that \u201c[w]e have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country\u201d, proposing now that the United States should lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature, and asking Congress \u201cto commit $15,000,000,000 over the next five years, including nearly $10,000,000,000 in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean\u201d.(29) On May 27, 2003(30) Between 2003 and 2008, the United States, through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and in conjunction with other bilateral programs and the multilateral Global Fund has helped to\u2014(A) provide antiretroviral therapy for over 1,900,000 people;(B) ensure that over 150,000 infants, most of whom would have likely been infected with HIV during pregnancy or childbirth, were not infected; and(C) provide palliative care and HIV prevention assistance to millions of other people.(31) While United States leadership in the battles against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria has had an enormous impact, these diseases continue to take a terrible toll on the human race.(32) According to the 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)\u2014(A) an estimated 2,100,000 people died of AIDS-related causes in 2007; and(B) an estimated 2,500,000 people were newly infected with HIV during that year.(33) According to the World Health Organization, malaria kills more than 1,000,000 people per year, 70 percent of whom are children under 5 years of age.(34) According to the World Health Organization, \u2153 of the world\u2019s population is infected with the tuberculosis bacterium, and tuberculosis is 1 of the greatest infectious causes of death of adults worldwide, killing 1,600,000 people per year.(35) Efforts to promote abstinence, fidelity, the correct and consistent use of condo", "ms, the delay of sexual debut, and the reduction of concurrent sexual partners represent important elements of strategies to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS.(36) According to UNAIDS\u2014(A) women and girls make up nearly 60 percent of persons in sub-Saharan Africa who are HIV positive;(B) women and girls are more biologically, economically, and socially vulnerable to HIV infection; and(C) gender issues are critical components in the effort to prevent HIV/AIDS and to care for those affected by the disease.(37) Children who have lost a parent to HIV/AIDS, who are otherwise directly affected by the disease, or who live in areas of high HIV prevalence may be vulnerable to the disease or its socioeconomic effects.(38) Lack of health capacity, including insufficient personnel and inadequate infrastructure, in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions of the world is a critical barrier that limits the effectiveness of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and to achieve other global health goals.(39) On March 30, 2007(A) have \u201cadversely affected implementation of the U.S. Global AIDS Initiative\u201d;(B) have inhibited comprehensive, integrated, evidence based approaches;(C) \u201chave been counterproductive\u201d;(D) \u201cmay have been helpful initially in ensuring a balance of attention to activities within the 4 categories of prevention, treatment, care, and orphans and vulnerable children\u201d;(E) \u201chave also limited PEPFAR\u2019s ability to tailor its activities in each country to the local epidemic and to coordinate with the level of activities in the countries\u2019 national plans\u201d; and(F) should be removed by Congress and replaced with more appropriate mechanisms that\u2014(i) \u201censure accountability for results from Country Teams to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and to Congress\u201d; and(ii) \u201censure that spending is directly linked to and commensurate with necessary efforts to achieve both country and overall performance targets for prevention, treatment, care, and orphans and vulnerable children\u201d.(40) The United States Government has end", "orsed the principles of harmonization in coordinating efforts to combat HIV/AIDS commonly referred to as the \u201cThree Ones\u201d, which includes\u2014(A) 1 agreed HIV/AIDS action framework that provides the basis for coordination of the work of all partners;(B) 1 national HIV/AIDS coordinating authority, with a broadbased multisectoral mandate; and(C) 1 agreed HIV/AIDS country-level monitoring and evaluating system.(41) In the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases, of April 26\u201327, 2001 (referred to in this chapter as the \u201cAbuja Declaration\u201d), the Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)\u2014(A) declared that they would \u201cplace the fight against HIV/AIDS at the forefront and as the highest priority issue in our respective national development plans\u201d;(B) committed \u201cTO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP for the activities of the National AIDS Commissions/Councils\u201d;(C) resolved \u201cto lead from the front the battle against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases by personally ensuring that such bodies were properly convened in mobilizing our societies as a whole and providing focus for unified national policymaking and programme implementation, ensuring coordination of all sectors at all levels with a gender perspective and respect for human rights, particularly to ensure equal rights for people living with HIV/AIDS\u201d; and(D) pledged \u201cto set a target of allocating at least 15% of our annual budget to the improvement of the health sector\u201d.(Pub.

In recognition of the impact of malnutrition as a clinical health issue for many persons living with HIV/AIDS that is often associated with health and economic impacts on these individuals and their families, the Global AIDS Coordinator and the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall\u2014(A) follow World Health Organization guidelines for HIV/AIDS food and nutrition services;(B) integrate nutrition programs with HIV/AIDS activities through effective linkages among the health, agricultural, and livelihood sectors and establish additional services in circumstances in which referrals are inadequate or impossible;(C) provide, as a component of care and treatment programs for persons with HIV/AIDS, food and nutritional support to individuals infected with, and affected by, HIV/AIDS who meet established criteria for nutritional support (including clinically malnourished children and adults, and pregnant and lactating women in programs in need of supplemental support), including\u2014(i) anthropometric and dietary assessment;(ii) counseling; and(iii) therapeutic and supplementary feeding;(D) provide food and nutritional support for children affected by HIV/AIDS and to communities and households caring for children affected by HIV/AIDS; and(E) in communities where HIV/AIDS and food insecurity are highly prevalent, support programs to address these often intersecting health problems through commun", "ity-based assistance programs, with an emphasis on sustainable approaches.(2) Authorization of appropriationsOf the amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title(d) Eligibility for assistanceAn organization, including a faith-based organization, that is otherwise eligible to receive assistance under section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151b\u20132(1) shall not be required, as a condition of receiving such assistance\u2014(A) to endorse or utilize a multisectoral or comprehensive approach to combating HIV/AIDS; or(B) to endorse, utilize, make a referral to, become integrated with, or otherwise participate in any program or activity to which the organization has a religious or moral objection; and(2) shall not be discriminated against in the solicitation or issuance of grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under such provisions of law for refusing to meet any requirement described in paragraph (1).(e) LimitationNo funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking.

Also, there is evidence to suggest that the full benefit of therapy to treat HIV/AIDS may not be achieved in individuals who are malnourished, particularly in pregnant and lactating women.(2) Sense of CongressIt is therefore the sense of Congress that United States food assistance should be accepted by countries with large populations of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS, particularly African countries, in order to help feed such individuals.(Pub.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) Approximately 2,000 children around the world are infected each day with HIV through mother-to-child transmission. Transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor, and delivery or through breast feeding. Over 90 percent of these cases are in developing nations with little or no access to public health facilities.(2) Mother-to-child transmission is largely preventable with the proper application of pharmaceuticals, therapies, and other public health interventions.(3) Certain antiretroviral drugs reduce mother-to-child transmission by nearly 50 percent. Universal availability of this drug could prevent up to 400,000 infections per year and dramatically reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths.(4) At the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June 2001, the United States committed to the specific goals with respect to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, including the goals of reducing the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20 percent by the year 2005 and by 50 percent by the year 2010, as specified in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the Special Session.(5) Several United States Government agencies including the United States Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control are already supporting", " programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission in resource-poor nations and have the capacity to expand these programs rapidly by working closely with foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations.(6) Efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission can provide the basis for a broader response that includes care and treatment of mothers, fathers, and other family members who are infected with HIV or living with AIDS.(7) HIV/AIDS has devastated the lives of countless children and families across the globe. Since the epidemic began, an estimated 13,200,000 children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by AIDS, that is they have lost their mother or both parents to the disease. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that this number will double by the year 2010.(8) HIV/AIDS also targets young people between the ages of 15 to 24, particularly young women, many of whom carry the burden of caring for family members living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 10,300,000 young people are now living with HIV/AIDS. One-half of all new infections are occurring among this age group.(Pub.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) According to the Department of State, the Government of North Korea is \u201ca dictatorship under the absolute rule of Kim Jong Il\u201d that continues to commit numerous, serious human rights abuses.(2) The Government of North Korea attempts to control all information, artistic expression, academic works, and media activity inside North Korea and strictly curtails freedom of speech and access to foreign broadcasts.(3) The Government of North Korea subjects all its citizens to systematic, intensive political and ideological indoctrination in support of the cult of personality glorifying Kim Jong Il and the late Kim Il Sung that approaches the level of a state religion.(4) The Government of North Korea divides its population into categories, based on perceived loyalty to the leadership, which determines access to food, employment, higher education, place of residence, medical facilities, and other resources.(5) According to the Department of State, \u201c[t]he [North Korean] Penal Code is [d]raconian, stipulating capital punishment and confiscation of assets for a wide variety of \u2018crimes against the revolution,\u2019 including defection, attempted defection, slander of the policies of the Party or State, listening to foreign broadcasts, writing \u2018reactionary\u2019 letters, and possessing reactionary printed matter\u201d.(6) The Government of North Korea executes political prisoners, opponents of the regime, some repatriated defectors, some members of underground churches, and others, sometimes at public meetings attended by workers, students, and schoolchildren.(7) The Government of North Korea holds an estimated 200,000 political prisoners in camps that its State Security Agency manages through the use of forced labor, ", "beatings, torture, and executions, and in which many prisoners also die from disease, starvation, and exposure.(8) According to eyewitness testimony provided to the United States Congress by North Korean camp survivors, camp inmates have been used as sources of slave labor for the production of export goods, as targets for martial arts practice, and as experimental victims in the testing of chemical and biological poisons.(9) According to credible reports, including eyewitness testimony provided to the United States Congress, North Korean Government officials prohibit live births in prison camps, and forced abortion and the killing of newborn babies are standard prison practices.(10) According to the Department of State, \u201c[g]enuine religious freedom does not exist in North Korea\u201d and, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, \u201c[t]he North Korean state severely represses public and private religious activities\u201d with penalties that reportedly include arrest, imprisonment, torture, and sometimes execution.(11) More than 2,000,000 North Koreans are estimated to have died of starvation since the early 1990s because of the failure of the centralized agricultural and public distribution systems operated by the Government of North Korea.(12) According to a 2002 United Nations-European Union survey, nearly one out of every ten children in North Korea suffers from acute malnutrition and four out of every ten children in North Korea are chronically malnourished.(13) Since 1995, the United States has provided more than 2,000,000 tons of humanitarian food assistance to the people of North Korea, primarily through the World Food Program.(14) Although United States food assistance has undoubtedly saved many North Korean lives and there have been minor improvements in transparency relating to the distribution of such assistance in North Korea, the Government of North Korea continues to deny the World Food Program forms of access necessary to properly monitor the delivery of food aid, including", " the ability to conduct random site visits, the use of native Korean-speaking employees, and travel access throughout North Korea.(15) The risk of starvation, the threat of persecution, and the lack of freedom and opportunity in North Korea have caused large numbers, perhaps even hundreds of thousands, of North Koreans to flee their homeland, primarily into China.(16) North Korean women and girls, particularly those who have fled into China, are at risk of being kidnapped, trafficked, and sexually exploited inside China, where many are sold as brides or concubines, or forced to work as prostitutes.(17) The Governments of China and North Korea have been conducting aggressive campaigns to locate North Koreans who are in China without permission and to forcibly return them to North Korea, where they routinely face torture and imprisonment, and sometimes execution.(18) Despite China\u2019s obligations as a party to the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, China routinely classifies North Koreans seeking asylum in China as mere \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d and returns them to North Korea without regard to the serious threat of persecution they face upon their return.(19) The Government of China does not provide North Koreans whose asylum requests are rejected a right to have the rejection reviewed prior to deportation despite its obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.(20) North Koreans who seek asylum while in China are routinely imprisoned and tortured, and in some cases killed, after they are returned to North Korea.(21) The Government of China has detained, convicted, and imprisoned foreign aid workers attempting to assist North Korean refugees in proceedings that did not comply with Chinese law or international standards.(22) In January 2000, North Korean agents inside China allegedly abducted the Reverend Kim Dong-shik, a United States ", "permanent resident and advocate for North Korean refugees, whose condition and whereabouts remain unknown.(23) Between 1994 and 2003, South Korea has admitted approximately 3,800 North Korean refugees for domestic resettlement, a number that is small in comparison with the total number of North Korean escapees but far greater than the number legally admitted in any other country.(24) Although the principal responsibility for North Korean refugee resettlement naturally falls to the Government of South Korea, the United States should play a leadership role in focusing international attention on the plight of these refugees, and formulating international solutions to that profound humanitarian dilemma.(25) In addition to infringing the rights of its own citizens, the Government of North Korea has been responsible in years past for the abduction of numerous citizens of South Korea and Japan, whose condition and whereabouts remain unknown.(Pub.

L. 115\u2013198, \u00a7\u202f2July 20, 2018132 Stat. 1519\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) In 2014, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry (COI) on Human Rights in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) found that the grave human rights violations still being perpetrated against the people of North Korea, due to policies established at the highest level of the state, amount to crimes against humanity. Crimes include forced starvation, sexual violence against women and children, restrictions on freedom of movement, arbitrary detention, torture, executions, and enforced disappearances, among other hardships.\u201c(2) The COI also noted that the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China is aiding and abetting in crimes against humanity by forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees back to the DPRK. Upon repatriation, North Koreans are sent to prison camps, tortured, or even executed. The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s forcible repatriation of North Korean refugees violates its obligation to uphold the principle of non-refoulement, under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, done at Geneva July 28, 1951January 31, 1967\u201c(3) Estimates from the COI suggest that between 80,000 and 120,000 people are believed to be imprisoned in political prison camps in North Korea. Another 70,000 are believed to be held at other detention facilities. Prisoners in both situations are subject to harsh conditions, limited food, sexual abuse, and in most cases hard labor.\u201c(4) One of the findings of the COI report was the persecution of religious minorities, especially Christians. There is effectively no freedom of religion in North Korea, only worship of th", "e Kim family. Christians are subjected to particularly acute persecution. It has been reported that Christians in North Korea have been tortured, forcibly detained, and even executed for possessing a Bible or professing Christianity.\u201c(5) North Korea profits from its human rights abuses. A 2014 report from the Asian Institute for Policy Studies suggests that there are nearly 50,000 North Korean workers forced to labor overseas, sometimes without compensation, and for as much as 20 hours at a time. Workers that received compensation were not to be paid more than $150 per month, which is between 10 to 20 percent of the value of the labor they performed. Based on this report, the regime may profit as much as $360,000,000 annually from just 50,000 laborers.\u201c(6) On July 6, 2016Public Law 114\u201312222 U.S.C. 9201\u201c(7) The North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 114\u2013122\u201c(8) Although the United States Refugee Admissions Program remains the largest in the world by far, the United States has only resettled 212 refugees from North Korea since the date of the enactment of the North Korea[n] Human Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law 108\u2013333Oct. 18, 2004Pub.

Lilley also served as a director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea until his death in 2009.\u201c(8) Following his 18 years of service in the House of Representatives, including as Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Stephen J. Solarz committed himself to, in his words, highlighting \u2018the plight of ordinary North Koreans who are denied even the most basic human rights, and the dramatic and heart-rending stories of those who risk their lives in the struggle to escape what is certainly the world\u2019s worst nightmare\u2019, and served as co-chairman of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea until his death in 2010.\u201dPub.

According to recent reports, the Chinese Government is shutting down Christian churches and imprisoning people who help North Korean defectors and has increased the bounty paid for turning in North Korean refugees.\u201c(5) In an attempt to deter escape attempts, the Government of North Korea has reportedly stepped up its public execution of border-crossers and those who help others cross into China.\u201c(6) In spite of the requirement of the Act that the Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea (the \u2018Special Envoy\u2019) report to the Congress no later than April 16, 2005August 19, 2005\u201c(7) The Special Envoy appointed by the President has filled that position on a part-time basis only.\u201c(8) Since the passage of the North Korean Human Rights Act, Congress has on several occasions expressed interest in the status of North Korean refugees, and on February 21, 2006\u201c(9) Although the United States refugee resettlement program remains the largest in the world by far, the United States has resettled only 37 North Koreans in the period from 2004 through 2007.\u201c(10) From the end of 2004 through 2007, the Republic of Korea resettled 5,961 North Koreans.\u201c(11) Extensive delays in assessment and processing have led numerous North Korean refugees to abandon their quest for United States resettlement, and long waits (of more than a year in some cases) have been the source of considerable discouragement and frustration among refugees, many of whom are awaiting United States resettlement in", " circumstances that are unsafe and insecure.\u201c(12) From 2000 through 2006, the United States granted asylum to 15 North Koreans, as compared to 60 North Korean asylum grantees in the United Kingdom, and 135 in Germany during that same period.\u201dSense of CongressPub.

While in captivity, Otto Warmbier suffered a serious medical emergency that placed him into a comatose state. Otto Warmbier was comatose upon his release in June 2017 and died 6 days later.\u201c(5) Despite increased penalties for possession and viewership of foreign media, the people of North Korean have increased their desire for foreign media content, according to a survey of 200 defectors concluding that 90 percent had watched South Korean or other foreign media before defecting.\u201c(6) On March 23, 2021\u201c(7) In 2018, Typhoon Yutu caused extensive damage to 15 broadcast antennas used by the United States Agency for Global Media in Asia, resulting in reduced programming to North Korea. The United States Agency for Global Media has rebuilt 5 of the 15 antenna systems as of June 2021.\u201c(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) in the event of a crisis situation, particularly where information pertaining to the crisis is being actively censored or a false narrative is being put forward, the United States should be able to quickly increase its broadcasting capability to deliver fact-based information to audiences, including those in North Korea; and\u201c(2) the United States International Broadcasting Surge Capacity Fund is already ", "authorized under section 316 of the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6216Statement of PolicyPub.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) The proliferation of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices poses a grave threat to the national security of the United States and its vital national interests.(2) The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has proven critical to limiting such proliferation.(3) For the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be effective, each of the non-nuclear-weapon State Parties must conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the IAEA, and such agreements must be honored and enforced.(4) Recent events emphasize the urgency of strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. This can best be accomplished by providing IAEA inspectors with more information about, and broader access to, nuclear activities within the territory of non-nuclear-weapon State Parties.(5) The proposed scope of such expanded information and access has been negotiated by the member states of the IAEA in the form of a Model Additional Protocol to its existing safeguards agreements, and universal acceptance of Additional Protocols by non-nuclear weapons states is essential to enhancing the effectiveness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.(6) On June 12, 1998(7) Implementation of the Additional Protocol in the United States in a manner consistent with United States obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty may encourage other parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, especially non-nuclear-weapon State Parties, to conclude Additional Protocols and thereby strengthen the Nuclear Non", "-Proliferation Treaty safeguards system and help reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation, which is of direct and substantial benefit to the United States.(8) Implementation of the Additional Protocol by the United States is not required and is completely voluntary given its status as a nuclear-weapon State Party, but the United States has acceded to the Additional Protocol to demonstrate its commitment to the nuclear nonproliferation regime and to make United States civil nuclear activities available to the same IAEA inspections as are applied in the case of non-nuclear-weapon State Parties.(9) In accordance with the national security exclusion contained in Article 1.b of its Additional Protocol, the United States will not allow any inspection activities, nor make any declaration of any information with respect to, locations, information, and activities of direct national security significance to the United States.(10) Implementation of the Additional Protocol will conform to the principles set forth in the letter of April 30, 2002(Pub.

Through civil society, citizens come together to hold their leaders accountable and address challenges that governments cannot tackle alone. Civil society organizations\u2014such as community groups, non-governmental organizations, labor unions, indigenous groups, charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, professional associations, and foundations\u2014often drive innovations and develop new ideas and approaches to solve social, economic, and political problems that governments can apply on a larger scale. Moreover, by giving people peaceful avenues to advance their interests and express their convictions, a free and flourishing civil society contributes to stability and helps to counter violent extremism. Countries should ensure that civil society organizations can engage freely in legitimate and peaceful activity, while recognizing the potential for illicit actors to abuse the sector and establishing proportionate and targeted safeguards to prevent that abuse.The rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and association that enable civil society to participate fully in social, economic, and political life are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In many parts of the world, however, these rights are in danger. An increasing number of governments are inhibiting the free operation of civil society and cutting off civil society organizations\u2019 ability to receive funding from legitimate s", "ources. In some cases, these restrictions arise out of the implementation of laws, regulations, and administrative measures that are being inappropriately applied; in other cases, the laws, regulations, and administrative measures are themselves problematic.

FindingsCongress finds the following:(1) The people of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the United States share a long history of friendship and comity, and the interests of both nations are well-served by strengthening and deepening this friendship.(2) Since 2001, the United States has contributed more than $15,000,000,000 to Pakistan, of which more than $10,000,000,000 has been security-related assistance and direct payments.(3) With the free and fair election of February 18, 2008(4) Pakistan is a major non-NATO ally of the United States and has been a valuable partner in the battle against al Qaeda and the Taliban, but much more remains to be accomplished by both nations.(5) The struggle against al Qaeda, the Taliban, and affiliated terrorist groups has led to the deaths of several thousand Pakistani civilians and members of the security forces of Pakistan over the past seven years.(6) Despite killing or capturing hundreds of al Qaeda operatives and other terrorists\u2014including major al Qaeda leaders, such as Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Abu Faraj al-Libi\u2014the FATA, parts of the NWFP, Quetta in Balochistan, and Muridke in Punjab remain a sanctuary for al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban, the Terikh-e Taliban and affiliated groups from which these groups organize terrorist actions against Pakistan and other countries.(7) The security forces of Pakistan have struggled to contain a Taliban-backed insurgency, recently taking direct action against those who threaten Pakistan\u2019s security and stability, including military operations in the FATA and the NWFP.(8) On March 27, 2009(9) According to a Government Accountability Office report (GAO\u201308\u2013622), \u201csince 2003, the [A]dministration\u2019s national security strategies and Congress have recognized that a comprehensive plan that includes all elements of national power\u2014", "diplomatic, military, intelligence, development assistance, economic, and law enforcement support\u2014was needed to address the terrorist threat emanating from the FATA\u201d and that such a strategy was also mandated by section 7102(b)(3) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 108\u201345822 U.S.C. 2656f11Public Law 110\u20135322 U.S.C. 2375(10) During 2008 and 2009, the people of Pakistan have been especially hard hit by rising food and commodity prices and severe energy shortages, with \u2154 of the population living on less than $2 a day and \u2155 of the population living below the poverty line according to the United Nations Development Program.(11) Economic growth is a fundamental foundation for human security and national stability in Pakistan, a country with more than 175,000,000 people, an annual population growth rate of two percent, and a ranking of 136 out of 177 countries in the United Nations Human Development Index.(12) The 2009 Pakistani military offensive in the NWFP and the FATA displaced millions of residents in one of the gravest humanitarian crises Pakistan has faced, and despite the heroic efforts of Pakistanis to respond to the needs of the displaced millions and facilitate the return of many, it has highlighted the need for Pakistan to develop an effective national counterinsurgency strategy.(Pub.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) In late 2008, Malala Yousafzai began making the case for access to education for women and girls despite objections from the Pakistani Taliban. On October 9, 2012\u201c(2) In 2013, Malala Yousafzai and her father Ziauddin Yousafzai co-founded the Malala Fund. The Malala Fund works to secure 12 years of free, safe, and quality education for all girls. Completion of a full 12-year cycle of primary and secondary education ensures a pipeline of girls able to pursue higher education.\u201c(3) On July 12, 2013\u201c(4) On October 10, 2014\u201c(5) According to the United Nations 2016 Global Education Monitoring Report, more than 130 million girls worldwide are out of school. 15 million girls of primary-school age will never enter a classroom. As of 2016, at least 500 million adult women across the globe are illiterate.\u201c(6) According to the World Bank, \u2018Girls\u2019 education is a strategic development priority. Better educated women tend to be healthier, participate more in the formal labor market, earn higher incomes, *\u2000*\u2000* marry at a later age, and enable better health care and education for their children, should they choose to become mothers. All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and nations out of poverty.\u2019.\u201c(7) In 2015, all United Nations Member States, including the United States, adopted quality education, including access to higher ", "education, and gender equality as sustainable development goals to be attained by 2030. One of the education goal targets is to \u2018ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university\u2019.\u201c(8) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stated, \u2018We will open the doors of education to all citizens, but especially to girls and women\u2000*\u2000*\u2000*. We are doing all of these things because we have seen that when women and girls have the tools to stay healthy and the opportunity to contribute to their families\u2019 well-being, they flourish and so do the people around them.[\u2019]\u201c(9) In February 2019, the White House launched the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative to advance women\u2019s economic empowerment across the globe and reach more than 100,000 women.\u201c(10) The World Economic Forum ranks Pakistan the second lowest among all countries in the world evaluated for gender equality. On educational attainment for women, Pakistan is ranked the tenth lowest.\u201c(11) In Pakistan, the rate of higher education enrollment beyond high school for girls and women is just 9 percent as reported by the World Bank. The global rate is 40 percent. Less than 6 percent of women 25 and older in Pakistan attain a bachelor\u2019s degree or equivalent as of 2016.\u201c(12) Factors such as poverty, early marriage, disability, ethnicity, and religion can contribute to the lack of educational opportunities for women in marginalized communities.\u201c(13) According to the World Bank, \u2018Higher education benefits both individuals and society. Economic returns for college graduates are the highest in the entire educational system\u2014an average 17 percent increase in earnings per year of schooling as compared with 10 percent for primary school.\u2019.\u201c(14) The United States provides critical foreign assistance to Pakistan\u2019s education sector to improve access to and the quality of basic and higher education.

Better educated women tend to be healthier, participate more in the formal labor market, earn higher incomes, *\u2000*\u2000* marry at a later age, and enable better health care and education for their children, should they choose to become mothers. All these factors combined can help lift households, communities, and nations out of poverty.\u2019.\u201c(7) In 2015, all United Nations Member States, including the United States, adopted quality education, including access to higher education, and gender equality as sustainable development goals to be attained by 2030. One of the education goal targets is to \u2018ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education, including university\u2019.\u201c(8) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stated, \u2018We will open the doors of education to all citizens, but especially to girls and women\u2000*\u2000*\u2000*. We are doing all of these things because we have seen that when women and girls have the tools to stay healthy and the opportunity to contribute to their families\u2019 well-being, they flourish and so do the people around them.[\u2019]\u201c(9) In February 2019, the White House launched the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative to advance women\u2019s economic empowerment across the globe and reach more than 100,000 women.\u201c(10) The World Economic Forum ranks Pakistan the second lowest among all countries in the world evaluated for gender equality. On educational attainment for women, Pakistan i", "s ranked the tenth lowest.\u201c(11) In Pakistan, the rate of higher education enrollment beyond high school for girls and women is just 9 percent as reported by the World Bank. The global rate is 40 percent. Less than 6 percent of women 25 and older in Pakistan attain a bachelor\u2019s degree or equivalent as of 2016.\u201c(12) Factors such as poverty, early marriage, disability, ethnicity, and religion can contribute to the lack of educational opportunities for women in marginalized communities.\u201c(13) According to the World Bank, \u2018Higher education benefits both individuals and society. Economic returns for college graduates are the highest in the entire educational system\u2014an average 17 percent increase in earnings per year of schooling as compared with 10 percent for primary school.\u2019.\u201c(14) The United States provides critical foreign assistance to Pakistan\u2019s education sector to improve access to and the quality of basic and higher education. Since 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (referred to in this Act as \u2018USAID\u2019) has awarded more than 6,000 scholarships for young women to receive higher education in Pakistan.\u201c(15) The Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program administered by USAID awards scholarships to academically talented, financially needy Pakistani students from all regions, including female students from rural areas of the country, to pursue bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees at participating Pakistani universities. \u201cSEC. 3.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of Iran, combined with its development of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and its support for international terrorism, represent a threat to the security of the United States, its strong ally Israel, and other allies of the United States around the world.(2) The United States and other res", "ponsible countries have a vital interest in working together to prevent the Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.(3) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly called attention to Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear activities and, as a result, the United Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions designed to encourage the Government of Iran to suspend those activities and comply with its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968March 5, 1970(4) The serious and urgent nature of the threat from Iran demands that the United States work together with its allies to do everything possible\u2014diplomatically, politically, and economically\u2014to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.(5) The United States and its major European allies, including the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, have advocated that sanctions be strengthened should international diplomatic efforts fail to achieve verifiable suspension of Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment program and an end to its nuclear weapons program and other illicit nuclear activities.(6) The Government of Iran continues to engage in serious, systematic, and ongoing violations of human rights, including suppression of freedom of expression and religious freedom, illegitimately prolonged detention, torture, and executions. Such violations have increased in the aftermath of the fraudulent presidential election in Iran on June 12, 2009(7) The Government of Iran has been unresponsive to President Obama\u2019s unprecedented and serious efforts at engagement, revealing that the Government of Iran is not interested in a diplomatic resolution, as made clear, for example, by the following:(A) Iran\u2019s apparent rejection of the Tehran Research Reactor plan, generously offered by the United States and its partners, of potentially great benefit to the people of Iran, and endorsed by Iran\u2019s own negotiators in October 2009.(B) Iran\u2019s ongoing clandestine nuclear program, as", " evidenced by its work on the secret uranium enrichment facility at Qom, its subsequent refusal to cooperate fully with inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, and its announcement that it would build 10 new uranium enrichment facilities.(C) Iran\u2019s official notification to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would enrich uranium to the 20 percent level, followed soon thereafter by its providing to that Agency a laboratory result showing that Iran had indeed enriched some uranium to 19.8 percent.(D) A February 18, 2010(E) A May 31, 2010(F) Iran\u2019s announcement in April 2010 that it had developed a new, faster generation of centrifuges for enriching uranium.(G) Iran\u2019s ongoing arms exports to, and support for, terrorists in direct contravention of United Nations Security Council resolutions.(H) Iran\u2019s July 31, 2009(8) There is an increasing interest by State governments, local governments, educational institutions, and private institutions, business firms, and other investors to disassociate themselves from companies that conduct business activities in the energy sector of Iran, since such business activities may directly or indirectly support the efforts of the Government of Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons capability.(9) Black market proliferation networks continue to flourish in the Middle East, allowing countries like Iran to gain access to sensitive dual-use technologies.(10) Economic sanctions imposed pursuant to the provisions of this Act, the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended by this Act, and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701(Pub.

IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS ON IRAN\u2019S SUPREME LEADER\u2019S OFFICE, ITS APPOINTEES, AND ANY AFFILIATED PERSONS.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) The Supreme Leader is an institution of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201c(2) The Supreme Leader holds ultimate authority over Iran\u2019s judiciary and security apparatus, including the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, law enforcement forces under the Interior Ministry, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and the Basij, a nationwide volunteer paramilitary group subordinate to the IRGC, all of which have engaged in human rights abus", "es in Iran. Additionally the IRGC, a United States designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, which reports to the Supreme Leader, continues to perpetrate terrorism around the globe, including attempts to kill and kidnap American citizens on United States soil.\u201c(3) The Supreme Leader appoints the head of Iran\u2019s judiciary. International observers continue to criticize the lack of independence of Iran\u2019s judicial system and maintained that trials disregarded international standards of fairness.\u201c(4) The revolutionary courts, created by Iran\u2019s former Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, within Iran\u2019s judiciary, are chiefly responsible for hearing cases of political offenses, operate in parallel to Iran\u2019s criminal justice system and routinely hold grossly unfair trials without due process, handing down predetermined verdicts and rubberstamping executions for political purpose.\u201c(5) The Iranian security and law enforcement forces engage in serious human rights abuse at the behest of the Supreme Leader.\u201c(6) Iran\u2019s President, Ebrahim Raisi, sits at the helm of the most sanctioned cabinet in Iranian history which includes internationally sanctioned rights violators. Raisi has supported the recent crackdown on protestors and is a rights violator himself, having served on a \u2018death commission\u2019 in 1988 that led to the execution of several thousand political prisoners in Iran. He most recently served as the head of Iran\u2019s judiciary, a position appointed by Iran\u2019s current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and may likely be a potential candidate to replace Khamenei as Iran\u2019s next Supreme Leader.\u201c(7) On September 16, 2022\u201c(8) In the course of the protests, the Iranian security forces\u2019 violent crackdown includes mass arrests, well documented beating of protestors, throttling of the internet and telecommunications services, and shooting protestors with live ammunition. Iranian security forces have reportedly killed hundreds of protestors and other civilians, including women and children, and wounded many more.\u201c(9) Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader is th", "e leader of the \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019, which is a network of Tehran\u2019s terror proxy and partner militias materially supported by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that targets the United States as well as its allies and partners.\u201c(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) the United States shall stand with and support the people of Iran in their demand for fundamental human rights;\u201c(2) the United States shall continue to hold the Islamic Republic of Iran, particularly the Supreme Leader and President, accountable for abuses of human rights, corruption, and export of terrorism; and\u201c(3) Iran must immediately end its gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u201c(c) In General.\u2014\u201c(1) Determination and report requiredNot later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this division [Apr. 24, 2024\u201c(A) determine whether each foreign person described in subsection (d) meets the criteria for imposition of sanctions under one or more of the sanctions programs and authorities listed in paragraph (2);\u201c(B) impose applicable sanctions against any foreign person determined to meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions pursuant to subparagraph (A) under the sanctions programs and authorities listed in subparagraph (A) or (F) of subsection (c)(2) and pursue applicable sanctions against any foreign person determined to meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions pursuant to subparagraph (A) under the sanctions programs and authorities listed in subparagraph (B), (C), (D), or (E) of subsection (c)(2); and\u201c(C) submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report in unclassified form, with a classified annex provided separately if needed, containing\u2014\u201c(i) a list of all foreign persons described in subsection (d) that meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions under one or more of the sanctions programs and authorities listed in paragraph (2); and\u201c(ii) for each foreign person identified pursuant to clause (i)\u2014\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u201c(I) a list of each sanctions program or authority listed in paragrap", "h (2) for which the person meets the criteria for imposition of sanctions;\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u201c(II) a statement which, if any, of the sanctions authorized by any of the sanctions programs and authorities identified pursuant to subclause (I) have been imposed or will be imposed within 30 days of the submission of the report; and\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u201c(III) with respect to which any of the sanctions authorized by any of the sanctions programs and authorities identified pursuant to subclause (I) have not been imposed and will not be imposed within 30 days of the submission of the report, the specific authority under which otherwise applicable sanctions are being waived, have otherwise been determined not to apply, or are not being imposed and a complete justification of the decision to waive or otherwise not apply the sanctions authorized by such sanctions programs and authorities.\u201c(2) Sanctions listedThe sanctions listed in this paragraph are the following:\u201c(A) Sanctions described in section 105(c) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514(c)\u201c(B) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13553 (50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(C) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(D) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13818 [50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(E) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13876 [50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(F) Penalties and visa bans applicable with respect to a person pursuant to section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2021 [div.

IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS ON IRAN\u2019S SUPREME LEADER\u2019S OFFICE, ITS APPOINTEES, AND ANY AFFILIATED PERSONS.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) The Supreme Leader is an institution of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201c(2) The Supreme Leader holds ultimate authority over Iran\u2019s judiciary and security apparatus, including the Ministry of Intelligence and Security, law enforcement forces under the Interior Ministry, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and the Basij, a nationwide volunteer paramilitary group subordinate to the IRGC, all of which have engaged in human rights abuses in Iran. Additionally the IRGC, a United States designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, which reports to the Supreme Leader, continues to perpetrate terr", "orism around the globe, including attempts to kill and kidnap American citizens on United States soil.\u201c(3) The Supreme Leader appoints the head of Iran\u2019s judiciary. International observers continue to criticize the lack of independence of Iran\u2019s judicial system and maintained that trials disregarded international standards of fairness.\u201c(4) The revolutionary courts, created by Iran\u2019s former Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini, within Iran\u2019s judiciary, are chiefly responsible for hearing cases of political offenses, operate in parallel to Iran\u2019s criminal justice system and routinely hold grossly unfair trials without due process, handing down predetermined verdicts and rubberstamping executions for political purpose.\u201c(5) The Iranian security and law enforcement forces engage in serious human rights abuse at the behest of the Supreme Leader.\u201c(6) Iran\u2019s President, Ebrahim Raisi, sits at the helm of the most sanctioned cabinet in Iranian history which includes internationally sanctioned rights violators. Raisi has supported the recent crackdown on protestors and is a rights violator himself, having served on a \u2018death commission\u2019 in 1988 that led to the execution of several thousand political prisoners in Iran. He most recently served as the head of Iran\u2019s judiciary, a position appointed by Iran\u2019s current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and may likely be a potential candidate to replace Khamenei as Iran\u2019s next Supreme Leader.\u201c(7) On September 16, 2022\u201c(8) In the course of the protests, the Iranian security forces\u2019 violent crackdown includes mass arrests, well documented beating of protestors, throttling of the internet and telecommunications services, and shooting protestors with live ammunition. Iranian security forces have reportedly killed hundreds of protestors and other civilians, including women and children, and wounded many more.\u201c(9) Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader is the leader of the \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019, which is a network of Tehran\u2019s terror proxy and partner militias materially supported by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard ", "Corps that targets the United States as well as its allies and partners.\u201c(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) the United States shall stand with and support the people of Iran in their demand for fundamental human rights;\u201c(2) the United States shall continue to hold the Islamic Republic of Iran, particularly the Supreme Leader and President, accountable for abuses of human rights, corruption, and export of terrorism; and\u201c(3) Iran must immediately end its gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.\u201c(c) In General.\u2014\u201c(1) Determination and report requiredNot later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this division [Apr. 24, 2024\u201c(A) determine whether each foreign person described in subsection (d) meets the criteria for imposition of sanctions under one or more of the sanctions programs and authorities listed in paragraph (2);\u201c(B) impose applicable sanctions against any foreign person determined to meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions pursuant to subparagraph (A) under the sanctions programs and authorities listed in subparagraph (A) or (F) of subsection (c)(2) and pursue applicable sanctions against any foreign person determined to meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions pursuant to subparagraph (A) under the sanctions programs and authorities listed in subparagraph (B), (C), (D), or (E) of subsection (c)(2); and\u201c(C) submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report in unclassified form, with a classified annex provided separately if needed, containing\u2014\u201c(i) a list of all foreign persons described in subsection (d) that meet the criteria for imposition of sanctions under one or more of the sanctions programs and authorities listed in paragraph (2); and\u201c(ii) for each foreign person identified pursuant to clause (i)\u2014\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u201c(I) a list of each sanctions program or authority listed in paragraph (2) for which the person meets the criteria for imposition of sanctions;\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u201c(II) a statement which, if any, of the sanctions authorized by any of the sanct", "ions programs and authorities identified pursuant to subclause (I) have been imposed or will be imposed within 30 days of the submission of the report; and\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u2001\u201c(III) with respect to which any of the sanctions authorized by any of the sanctions programs and authorities identified pursuant to subclause (I) have not been imposed and will not be imposed within 30 days of the submission of the report, the specific authority under which otherwise applicable sanctions are being waived, have otherwise been determined not to apply, or are not being imposed and a complete justification of the decision to waive or otherwise not apply the sanctions authorized by such sanctions programs and authorities.\u201c(2) Sanctions listedThe sanctions listed in this paragraph are the following:\u201c(A) Sanctions described in section 105(c) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514(c)\u201c(B) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13553 (50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(C) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(D) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13818 [50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(E) Sanctions applicable with respect to a person pursuant to Executive Order 13876 [50 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(F) Penalties and visa bans applicable with respect to a person pursuant to section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2021 [div.

FindingsCongress finds that the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran surveils, harasses, terrorizes, tortures, abducts, and murders individuals who peacefully defend human rights and freedoms in Iran, and innocent entities and individuals considered by the Government of Iran to be enemies of that regime, including United States citizens on United States soil, and takes foreign nationals hostage, including in the following instances:(1) In 2021, Iranian intelligence agents were indicted for plotting to kidnap United States citizen, women\u2019s rights activist, and journalist Masih Alinejad, from her home in New York City, in retaliation for exercising her rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Iranian agents allegedly spent at least approximately half a million dollars to capture the outspoken critic of the authoritarianism of the G", "overnment of Iran, and studied evacuating her by military-style speedboats to Venezuela before rendition to Iran.(2) Prior to the New York kidnapping plot, Ms. Alinejad\u2019s family in Iran was instructed by authorities to lure Ms. Alinejad to Turkey. In an attempt to intimidate her into silence, the Government of Iran arrested 3 of Ms. Alinejad\u2019s family members in 2019, and sentenced her brother to 8 years in prison for refusing to denounce her.(3) According to Federal prosecutors, the same Iranian intelligence network that allegedly plotted to kidnap Ms. Alinejad is also targeting critics of the Government of Iran who live in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates.(4) In 2021, an Iranian diplomat was convicted in Belgium of attempting to carry out a 2018 bombing of a dissident rally in France.(5) In 2021, a Danish high court found a Norwegian citizen of Iranian descent guilty of illegal espionage and complicity in a failed plot to kill an Iranian Arab dissident figure in Denmark.(6) In 2021, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) appealed to the United Nations to protect BBC Persian employees in London who suffer regular harassment and threats of kidnapping by Iranian government agents.(7) In 2021, 15 militants allegedly working on behalf of the Government of Iran were arrested in Ethiopia for plotting to attack citizens of Israel, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates, according to United States officials.(8) In 2020, Iranian agents allegedly kidnapped United States resident and Iranian-German journalist Jamshid Sharmahd, while he was traveling to India through Dubai. Iranian authorities announced they had seized Mr. Sharmahd in \u201ca complex operation\u201d, and paraded him blindfolded on state television. Mr. Sharmahd is arbitrarily detained in Iran, allegedly facing the death penalty. In 2009, Mr. Sharmahd was the target of an alleged Iran-directed assassination plot in Glendora, California.(9) In 2020, the Government of Turkey released counterterrorism files exposing how Iranian authori", "ties allegedly collaborated with drug gangs to kidnap Habib Chabi, an Iranian-Swedish activist for Iran\u2019s Arab minority.

The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran continues to add to its arsenal of ballistic missiles and cruise missiles, which threaten Iran\u2019s neighbors, Israel, and United States Armed Forces in the region.(7) As a result, Israel is facing a fundamentally altered strategic environment.(8) Pursuant to chapter 5 of title 1 of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law 108\u201311117 Stat. 576September 30, 2012(Pub.
