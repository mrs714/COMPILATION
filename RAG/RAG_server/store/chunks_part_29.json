Congressional findingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) The National Commission on Fire Prevention and Control, established pursuant to Public Law 90\u2013259(2) The United States today has the highest per capita rate of death and property loss from fire of all the major industrialized nations in the world.(3) Fire is an undue burden affecting all Americans, and fire also constitutes a public health and safety problem of great dimensions. Fire kills 12,000 and scars and injures 300,000 Americans each year, including 50,000 individuals who require extended hospitalization. Almost $3 billion worth of property is destroyed annually by fire, and the total economic cost of destructive fire in the United States is estimated conservatively to be $11,000,000,000 per year. Firefighting is the Nation\u2019s most hazardous profession.(4) Such losses of life and property from fire are unacceptable to the Congress.(5) While fire prevention and control is and should remain a State and local responsibility, the Federal Government must help if a significant reduction in fire losses is to be achieved.(6) The fire service and the civil defense program in each locality would both benefit from closer cooperation.(7) The Nation\u2019s fire problem is exacerbated by (A) the indifference with which some Americans confront the subject; (B) the Nation\u2019s failure to undertake enough research and development into fire and fire-related problems; (C) the scarcity of reliable data and information; (D) the fact that designers and purchasers of buildings and products generally give insufficient attention to fire safety; (E) the fact that many communities lack adequate building and fire prevention codes; and (F) the fact that local fire departments spend about 95 cents of every dollar appropriated to the fire services on efforts to extinguish fire", "s and only about 5 cents on fire prevention.(8) There is a need for improved professional training and education oriented toward improving the effectiveness of the fire services, including an increased emphasis on preventing fires and on reducing injuries to firefighters.(9) A national system for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of fire data is needed to help local fire services establish research and action priorities.(10) The number of specialized medical centers which are properly equipped and staffed for the treatment of burns and the rehabilitation of victims of fires is inadequate.(11) The unacceptably high rates of death, injury, and property loss from fire can be reduced if the Federal Government establishes a coordinated program to support and reinforce the fire prevention and control activities of State and local governments.(Pub.

L. 103\u2013254, \u00a7\u202f2May 19, 1994108 Stat. 679\n\u201cCongress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) arson is a serious and costly problem, and is responsible for approximately 25 percent of all fires in the United States;\u201c(2) arson is a leading cause of fire deaths, accounting for approximately 700 deaths annually in the United States, and is the leading cause of property damage due to fire in the United States;\u201c(3) estimates of arson property losses are in the range of $2,000,000,000 annually, or approximately 1 of every 4 dollars lost to fire;\u201c(4) the incidence of arson in the United States is seriously underreported, in part because of the lack of adequate participation by local jurisdictions in the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) and the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program;\u201c(5) there is a need for expanded training programs for arson investigators;\u201c(6) there is a need for improved programs designed to enable volunteer firefighters to detect arson crimes and to preserve evidence vital to the investigation and prosecution of arson cases;\u201c(7) according to the N", "ational Fire Protection Association, of all the suspicious and incendiary fires estimated to occur, only \u2153 are confirmed as arson; and\u201c(8) improved training of arson investigators will increase the ability of fire departments to identify suspicious and incendiary fires, and will result in increased and more effective prosecution of arson offenses.\u201dCongressional Findings and PurposePub. L. 110\u2013376, \u00a7\u202f2Oct. 8, 2008122 Stat. 4056\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The number of lives lost each year because of fire has dropped significantly over the last 25 years in the United States. However, the United States still has one of the highest fire death rates in the industrialized world. In 2006, the National Fire Protection Association reported 3,245 civilian fire deaths, 16,400 civilian fire injuries, and $11,307,000,000 in direct losses due to fire.\u201c(2) Every year, more than 100 firefighters die in the line of duty. The United States Fire Administration should continue its leadership to help local fire agencies dramatically reduce these fatalities.\u201c(3) The Federal Government should continue to work with State and local governments and the fire service community to further the promotion of national voluntary consensus standards that increase firefighter safety.\u201c(4) The United States Fire Administration provides crucial support to the 30,300 fire departments of the United States through training, emergency incident data collection, fire awareness and education, and support of research and development activities for fire prevention, control, and suppression technologies.\u201c(5) The collection of data on fire and other emergency incidents is a vital tool both for policy makers and emergency responders to identify and develop responses to emerging hazards. Improving the data collection capabilities of the United States Fire Administration is essential for accurately tracking and responding to the magnitude and nature of the fire problems of the United States.\u201c(6) The research and development performed by the Nationa", "l Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States Fire Administration, other government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations on fire technologies, techniques, and tools advance the capabilities of the fire service of the United States to suppress and prevent fires.\u201c(7) Because of the essential role of the United States Fire Administration and the fire service community in preparing for and responding to national [probably should be \u201cnatural\u201d] and man-made disasters, the United States Fire Administration should have a prominent place within the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security.\u201dPub.

GENERAL PROVISIONSSec. 301. Transfer and Abolishment of Agencies and OfficersThe National Fire Prevention and Control Administration and the National Academy for Fire Prevention and Control and the positions of Administrator of said Administration and Superintendent of said Academy are hereby transferred to the Agency. The position of Deputy Administrator of said Administration (established by 15 U.S.C. 2204(c)Sec. 302. Incidental TransfersSo much of the personne", "l, property, records, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations and other funds employed, used, held, available, or to be made available in connection with the functions transferred under this Plan, as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall determine, shall be transferred to the appropriate agency, or component at such time or times as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall provide, except that no such unexpended balances transferred shall be used for purposes other than those for which the appropriation was originally made. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall provide for terminating the affairs of any agencies abolished herein and for such further measures and dispositions as such Director deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Reorganization Plan.Sec. 303. Interim OfficersThe President may authorize any persons who, immediately prior to the effective date of this Plan, held positions in the Executive Branch to which they were appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to act as Director, Deputy Director, and Associate Directors of the Agency, until those offices are for the first time filled pursuant to the provisions of this Reorganization Plan or by recess appointment, as the case may be. The President may authorize any such person to receive the compensation attached to the Office in respect of which that person so serves, in lieu of other compensation from the United States.Sec. 304. Effective DateThe provisions of this Reorganization Plan shall become effective at such time or times, on or before April 1, 1979Section 906 of Title 5[Pursuant to Ex. Ord. 12127, Mar. 31, 1979Apr. 1, 1979Message of the PresidentTo the Congress of the United States:Today I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978. The plan improves Federal emergency management and assistance. By consolidating emergency preparedness, mitigation and response activities, it cuts duplicative administrative costs and strengthens our ability", " to deal effectively with emergencies.The plan, together with changes I will make through Executive action, would merge five agencies from the Departments of Defense, Commerce, HUD, and GSA into one new agency.For the first time, key emergency management and assistance functions would be unified and made directly accountable to the President and Congress. This will reduce pressures for increased costs to serve similar goals.The present situation has severely hampered Federal support of State and local emergency organizations and resources, which bear the primary responsibility for preserving life and property in times of calamity. This reorganization has been developed in close cooperation with State and local governments.If approved by the Congress, the plan will establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose Director shall report directly to the President. The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (in the Department of Commerce), the Federal Insurance Administration (in the Department of Housing and Urban Development), and oversight responsibility for the Federal Emergency Broadcast System (now assigned in the Executive Office of the President) would be transferred to the Agency. The Agency\u2019s Director, its Deputy Director, and its five principal program managers would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.If the plan takes effect, I will assign to the Federal Emergency Management Agency all authorities and functions vested by law in the President and presently delegated to the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (in the Department of Defense). This will include certain engineering and communications support functions for civil defense now assigned to the U.S. Army.I will also transfer to the new Agency all authorities and functions under the Disaster Relief Acts of 1970 and 1974 [sections 4401 et seq. and 5121 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] now delegated to the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration in the Department of Housing and", " Urban Development.I will also transfer all Presidential authorities and functions now delegated to the Federal Preparedness Agency in the General Services Administration, including the establishment of policy for the national stockpile. The stockpile disposal function, which is stat\u00adutorily assigned to the General Services Administration, would remain there. Once these steps have been taken by Executive Order, these three agencies would be abolished.Several additional transfers of emergency preparedness and mitigation functions would complete the consolidation. These include:Oversight of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, under Public Law 95\u2013124Coordination of Federal activities to promote dam safety, carried by the same Office.Responsibility for assistance to communities in the development of readiness plans for severe weather-related emergencies, including floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.Coordination of natural and nuclear disaster warning systems.Coordination of preparedness and planning to reduce the consequences of major terrorist incidents. This would not alter the present responsibility of the executive branch for reacting to the incidents themselves.This reorganization rests on several fundamental principles:First, Federal authorities to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to major civil emergencies should be supervised by one official responsible to the President and given attention by other officials at the highest levels.The new Agency would be in this position. To increase White House oversight and involvement still further, I shall establish by Executive Order an Emergency Management Committee, to be chaired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency Director. Its membership shall be comprised of the Assistants to the President for National Security, Domestic Affairs and Policy and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Director, Office of Management and Budget. It will advise the President on ways to meet national civil emergencies. It will also oversee and provide guidance on the managemen", "t of all Federal emergency authorities, advising the President on alternative approaches to improve performance and avoid excessive costs.Second, an effective civil defense system requires the most efficient use of all available emergency resourcesThe communications, warning, evacuation, and public education processes involved in preparedness for a possible nuclear attack should be developed, tested, and used for major natural and accidental disasters as well. Consolidation of civil defense functions in the new Agency will assure that attack readiness programs are effectively integrated into the preparedness organizations and programs of State and local government, private industry, and volunteer organizations.While serving an important \u201call hazards\u201d readiness and response role, civil defense must continue to be fully compatible with and be ready to play an important role in our Nation\u2019s overall strategic policy. Accordingly, to maintain a link between our strategic nuclear planning and our nuclear attack preparedness planning, I will make the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council responsible for oversight of civil defense related programs and policies of the new Agency. This will also include appropriate Department of Defense support in areas like program development, technical support, research, communications, intelligence and emergency operations.Third, whenever possible, emergency responsibilities should be extensions of the regular missions of Federal agenciesFourth, Federal hazard mitigation activities should be closely linked with emergency preparedness and response functionsThe affected hazard mitigation activities include the Federal Insurance Administration which seeks to reduce flood losses by assisting states and local governments in developing appropriate land uses and building standards and several agencies that presently seek to reduce fire and earthquake losses through research and education.Most State and local governments have consolidated emergency planning, preparedness and r", "esponse functions on an \u201call hazard\u201d basis to take advantage of the similarities in preparing for and responding to the full range of potential emergencies. The Federal Government can and should follow this lead.Each of the changes set forth in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5I do not expect these actions to result in any significant changes in program expenditures for those authorities to be transferred. However, cost savings of between $10 to $15 million annually can be achieved by consolidating headquarters and regional facilities and staffs. The elimination (through attrition) of about 300 jobs is also anticipated.The emergency planning and response authorities involved in this plan are vitally important to the security and well-being of our Nation. I urge the Congress to approve it.\nJimmy Carter.The White HouseJune 19, 1978\nEx. Ord. No. 12127. Transfer of Functions to Federal Emergency Management AgencyEx. Ord.

Remedies in consumer disputes(a) Informal dispute settlement procedures; establishment; rules setting forth minimum requirements; effect of compliance by warrantor; review of informal procedures or implementation by Commission; application to existing informal procedures(1) Congress hereby declares it to be its policy to encourage warrantors to establish procedures whereby consumer disputes are fairly and expeditiously settled through informal dispute settlement mechanisms.(2) The Commission shall prescribe rules setting forth minimum requirements for any informal dispute settlement procedure which is incorporated into the terms of a written warranty to which any provision of this chapter applies. Such rules shall provide for participation in such procedure by independent or governmental entities.(3) One or more warrantors may establish an informal dispute settlement procedure which meets the requirements of the Commission\u2019s rules under paragraph (2). If\u2014(A) a warrantor establishes such a proced", "ure,(B) such procedure, and its implementation, meets the requirements of such rules, and(C) he incorporates in a written warranty a requirement that the consumer resort to such procedure before pursuing any legal remedy under this section respecting such warranty,then (i) the consumer may not commence a civil action (other than a class action) under subsection (d) of this section unless he initially resorts to such procedure; and (ii) a class of consumers may not proceed in a class action under subsection (d) except to the extent the court determines necessary to establish the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs, unless the named plaintiffs (upon notifying the defendant that they are named plaintiffs in a class action with respect to a warranty obligation) initially resort to such procedure. In the case of such a class action which is brought in a district court of the United States, the representative capacity of the named plaintiffs shall be established in the application of rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In any civil action arising out of a warranty obligation and relating to a matter considered in such a procedure, any decision in such procedure shall be admissible in evidence.(4) The Commission on its own initiative may, or upon written complaint filed by any interested person shall, review the bona fide operation of any dispute settlement procedure resort to which is stated in a written warranty to be a prerequisite to pursuing a legal remedy under this section. If the Commission finds that such procedure or its implementation fails to comply with the requirements of the rules under paragraph (2), the Commission may take appropriate remedial action under any authority it may have under this chapter or any other provision of law.(5) Until rules under paragraph (2) take effect, this subsection shall not affect the validity of any informal dispute settlement procedure respecting consumer warranties, but in any action under subsection (d), the court may invalidate any such procedu", "re if it finds that such procedure is unfair.(b) Prohibited actsIt shall be a violation of section 45(a)(1) of this title(c) Injunction proceedings by Attorney General or Commission for deceptive warranty, noncompliance with requirements, or violating prohibitions; procedures; definitions(1) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction of any action brought by the Attorney General (in his capacity as such), or by the Commission by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose, to restrain (A) any warrantor from making a deceptive warranty with respect to a consumer product, or (B) any person from failing to comply with any requirement imposed on such person by or pursuant to this chapter or from violating any prohibition contained in this chapter. Upon proper showing that, weighing the equities and considering the Commission\u2019s or Attorney General\u2019s likelihood of ultimate success, such action would be in the public interest and after notice to the defendant, a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction may be granted without bond.

Congressional findings and policy(a) The Congress finds and declares that\u2014(1) the Nation\u2019s dependence on foreign sources of petroleum must be reduced, as such dependence jeopardizes national security, inhibits foreign policy, and undermines economic well-being;(2) the Nation\u2019s balance of payments is threatened by the need to import oil for the production of liquid fuel for gasoline-powered vehicles;(3) the single largest use o", "f petroleum supplies is in the field of transportation, for gasoline- and diesel-powered motor vehicles;(4) the expeditious introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles into the Nation\u2019s transportation fleet would substantially reduce such use and dependence;(5) such introduction is practicable and would be advantageous because\u2014(A) most urban driving consists of short trips, which are within the capability of electric and hybrid vehicles;(B) much rural and agricultural driving of automobiles, tractors, and trucks is within the capability of such vehicles;(C) electric and hybrid vehicles are more reliable and practical now than in the past because propulsion, control, and battery technologies have improved, and further significant improvements in such technologies are possible in the near term;(D) electric and hybrid vehicles use little or no energy when stopped in traffic, in contrast to conventional automobiles and trucks;(E) the power requirements of such vehicles could be satisfied by charging them during off-peak periods when existing electric generating plants are underutilized, thereby permitting more efficient use of existing generating capacity;(F) such vehicles do not emit any significant pollutants or noise; and(G) it is environmentally desirable for transportation systems to be powered from central sources, because pollutants emitted from stationary sources (such as electric generating plants) are potentially easier to control than pollutants emitted from moving vehicles; and(6) the introduction of electric and hybrid vehicles would be facilitated by the establishment of a Federal program of research, development, and demonstration to explore electric and hybrid vehicle technologies.(b) It is therefore declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter to\u2014(1) encourage and support accelerated research into, and development of, electric and hybrid vehicle technologies;(2) demonstrate the economic and technological practicability of electric and hybrid vehicles for personal and commercial use in u", "rban areas and for agricultural and personal use in rural areas;(3) facilitate, and remove barriers to, the use of electric and hybrid vehicles in lieu of gasoline- and diesel-powered motor vehicles, where practicable; and(4) promote the substitution of electric and hybrid vehicles for many gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles currently used in routine short-haul, low-load applications, where such substitution would be beneficial.(Pub.

Manufacturing and processing notices(a) In general(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and subsection (h), no person may\u2014(i) manufacture a new chemical substance on or after the 30th day after the date on which the Administrator first publishes the list required by section 2607(b) of this title(ii) manufacture or process any chemical substance for a use which the Administrator has determined, in accordance with paragraph (2), is a significant new use.(B) A person may take the actions described in subparagraph (A) if\u2014(i) such person submits to the Administrator, at least 90 days before such manufacture or processing, a notice, in accordance with subsection (d), of such person\u2019s intention to manufacture or process such substance and such person complies with any applicable requirement of, or imposed pursuant to, subsection (b), (e), or (f); and(ii) the Administrator\u2014(I) conducts a review of the notice; and(II) makes a determination under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (3) and takes the actions required in association with that determination under such subparagraph within the applicable review period.(2) A determination by the Administrator that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use with respect to which notification is required under ", "paragraph (1) shall be made by a rule promulgated after a consideration of all relevant factors, including\u2014(A) the projected volume of manufacturing and processing of a chemical substance,(B) the extent to which a use changes the type or form of exposure of human beings or the environment to a chemical substance,(C) the extent to which a use increases the magnitude and duration of exposure of human beings or the environment to a chemical substance, and(D) the reasonably anticipated manner and methods of manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, and disposal of a chemical substance.(3) Review and determinationWithin the applicable review period, subject to section 2617 of this title(A) that the relevant chemical substance or significant new use presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator under the conditions of use, in which case the Administrator shall take the actions required under subsection (f);(B) that\u2014(i) the information available to the Administrator is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and environmental effects of the relevant chemical substance or significant new use; or(ii)(I) in the absence of sufficient information to permit the Administrator to make such an evaluation, the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of such substance, or any combination of such activities, may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator; or(II) such substance is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may b", "e significant or substantial human exposure to the substance,in which case the Administrator shall take the actions required under subsection (e); or(C) that the relevant chemical substance or significant new use is not likely to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors, including an unreasonable risk to a potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation identified as relevant by the Administrator under the conditions of use, in which case the submitter of the notice may commence manufacture of the chemical substance or manufacture or processing for a significant new use.(4) Failure to render determination.\u2014(A) Failure to render determinationIf the Administrator fails to make a determination on a notice under paragraph (3) by the end of the applicable review period and the notice has not been withdrawn by the submitter, the Administrator shall refund to the submitter all applicable fees charged to the submitter for review of the notice pursuant to section 2625(b) of this title(B) Limitations(i) A refund of applicable fees under subparagraph (A) shall not be made if the Administrator certifies that the submitter has not provided information required under subsection (b) or has otherwise unduly delayed the process such that the Administrator is unable to render a determination within the applicable review period.(ii) A failure of the Administrator to render a decision shall not be deemed to constitute a withdrawal of the notice.(iii) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as relieving the Administrator or the submitter of the notice from any requirement of this section.(5) Article considerationThe Administrator may require notification under this section for the import or processing of a chemical substance as part of an article or category of articles under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) if the Administrator makes an affirmative finding in a rule under paragraph (2) that the reasonable potential for exposure to the chemical substance th", "rough the article or category of articles subject to the rule justifies notification.(b) Submission of information(1)(A) If (i) a person is required by subsection (a)(1) to submit a notice to the Administrator before beginning the manufacture or processing of a chemical substance, and (ii) such person is required to submit information for such substance pursuant to a rule, order, or consent agreement under section 2603 of this title(B) If\u2014(i) a person is required by subsection (a)(1) to submit a notice to the Administrator, and(ii) such person has been granted an exemption under section 2603(c) of this titlesection 2603 of this titlesuch person may not, before the expiration of the 90 day period which begins on the date of the submission in accordance with such rule of the information the submission or development of which was the basis for the exemption, manufacture such substance if such person is subject to subsection (a)(1)(A)(i) or manufacture or process such substance for a significant new use if the person is subject to subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii).(2)(A) If a person\u2014(i) is required by subsection (a)(1) to submit a notice to the Administrator before beginning the manufacture or processing of a chemical substance listed under paragraph (4), and(ii) is not required by a rule, order, or consent agreement under section 2603 of this titlesuch person may submit to the Administrator information prescribed by subparagraph (B) at the time notice is submitted in accordance with subsection (a)(1).(B) Information submitted pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be information which the person submitting the information believes shows that\u2014(i) in the case of a substance with respect to which notice is required under subsection (a)(1)(A)(i), the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the chemical substance or any combination of such activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, or(ii) in the case of a chemical substance with respect to which notice is r", "equired under subsection (a)(1)(A)(ii), the intended significant new use of the chemical substance will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.(3) Information submitted under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection or under subsection (e) shall be made available, subject to section 2613 of this title(4)(A)(i) The Administrator may, by rule, compile and keep current a list of chemical substances with respect to which the Administrator finds that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal, or any combination of such activities, presents or may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, without consideration of costs or other nonrisk factors.(ii) In making a finding under clause (i) that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical substance or any combination of such activities presents or may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, the Administrator shall consider all relevant factors, including\u2014(I) the effects of the chemical substance on health and the magnitude of human exposure to such substance; and(II) the effects of the chemical substance on the environment and the magnitude of environmental exposure to such substance.(B) The Administrator shall, in prescribing a rule under subparagraph (A) which lists any chemical substance, identify those uses, if any, which the Administrator determines, by rule under subsection (a)(2), would constitute a significant new use of such substance.(C) Any rule under subparagraph (A), and any substantive amendment or repeal of such a rule, shall be promulgated pursuant to the procedures specified in section 553 of title 5(c) Extension of review periodThe Administrator may for good cause extend for additional periods (not to exceed in the aggregate 90 days) the period, prescribed by subsection (a) or (b).

Congressional findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s rule on local educational agency inspecti", "on for, and notification of, the presence of friable asbestos-containing material in school buildings includes neither standards for the proper identification of asbestos-containing material and appropriate response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing material, nor a requirement that response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing material be carried out in a safe and complete manner once actions are found to be necessary. As a result of the lack of regulatory guidance from the Environmental Protection Agency, some schools have not undertaken response action while many others have undertaken expensive projects without knowing if their action is necessary, adequate, or safe. Thus, the danger of exposure to asbestos continues to exist in schools, and some exposure actually may have increased due to the lack of Federal standards and improper response action.(2) There is no uniform program for accrediting persons involved in asbestos identification and abatement, nor are local educational agencies required to use accredited contractors for asbestos work.(3) The guidance provided by the Environmental Protection Agency in its \u201cGuidance for Controlling Asbestos-Containing Material in Buildings\u201d is insufficient in detail to ensure adequate responses. Such guidance is intended to be used only until the regulations required by this subchapter become effective.(4) Because there are no Federal standards whatsoever regulating daily exposure to asbestos in other public and commercial buildings, persons in addition to those comprising the Nation\u2019s school population may be exposed daily to asbestos.(b) PurposeThe purpose of this subchapter is\u2014(1) to provide for the establishment of Federal regulations which require inspection for asbestos-containing material and implementation of appropriate response actions with respect to asbestos-containing material in the Nation\u2019s schools in a safe and complete manner;(2) to mandate safe and complete periodic reinspection of school buildings following response ac", "tions, where appropriate; and(3) to require the Administrator to conduct a study to find out the extent of the danger to human health posed by asbestos in public and commercial buildings and the means to respond to any such danger.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds and declares the following:(1) Weather and climate change affect food production, energy use, land use, water resources and other factors vital to national security and human welfare.(2) An ability to anticipate natural and man-induced changes in climate would contribute to the soundness of policy decisions in the public and private sectors.(3) Significant improvements in the ability to forecast climate on an intermediate and long-term basis are possible.(4) Information regarding climate is not being fully disseminated or used, and Federal efforts have given insufficient attention to assessing and applying this information.(5) Climate fluctuation and change occur on a global basis, and deficiencies exist in the system for monitoring global climate changes. International cooperation for the purpose of sharing the benefits and costs of a global effort to understand climate is essential.(6) The United States lacks a well-defined and coordinated program in climate-related research, monitoring, assessment of effects, and information utilization.(Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title [this note] may be cited as the \u2018Global Climate Protection Act of 1987\u2019.\u201cSEC. 1102. FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress finds as follows:\u201c(1) There exists evidence that manmade pollution\u2014the release of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and other trace gases into the atmosphere\u2014may be producing a long-term and substantial increase in the average temperature on Earth, a phenomenon known as global warming through the greenhouse effect.\u201c(2) By early in the next century, an increase in Earth temperature could\u2014\u201c(A) so alter global weather patterns as to have an effect on existing agricultural production and on the habitability of large portions of the Earth; and\u201c(B) cause thermal expansion of the oceans and partial melting of the polar ice caps and glaciers, resulting in rising sea levels.\u201c(3) Important research into the problem of climate change is now being conducted by various United States Government and international agencies, and the continuation and intensification of those efforts will be crucial to the development of an effective United States response.\u201c(4) While the consequences of the greenhouse effect may not be fully manifest until the next century, ongoing pollution and deforestation may be contributing now to an irreversible process. Necessary actions must be identified and implemented in time to protect the climate.\u201c(5) The global nature of this problem will require vigorous efforts to achieve international cooperation aimed at minimizing and responding to adverse climate change; such international cooperation will be greatly enhanced by United States leadership. A key step in international cooperation will be the meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environme", "nt Program, scheduled for June 1989, which will seek to determine a direction for worldwide efforts to control global climate change.\u201c(6) Effective United States leadership in the international arena will depend upon a coordinated national policy.\u201cSEC. 1103. MANDATE FOR ACTION ON THE GLOBAL CLIMATE.\u201c(a) Goals of United States PolicyUnited States policy should seek to\u2014\u201c(1) increase worldwide understanding of the greenhouse effect and its environmental and health consequences;\u201c(2) foster cooperation among nations to develop more extensive and coordinated scientific research efforts with respect to the greenhouse effect;\u201c(3) identify technologies and activities to limit mankind\u2019s adverse effect on the global climate by\u2014\u201c(A) slowing the rate of increase of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in the near term; and\u201c(B) stabilizing or reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases over the long term; and\u201c(4) work toward multilateral agreements.\u201c(b) Formulation of United States PolicyThe President, through the Environmental Protection Agency, shall be responsible for developing and proposing to Congress a coordinated national policy on global climate change. Such policy formulation shall consider research findings of the Committee on Earth Sciences of the Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Engineering Technology, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other organizations engaged in the conduct of scientific research.\u201c(c) Coordination of United States Policy in the International ArenaThe Secretary of State shall be responsible to coordinate those aspects of United States policy requiring action through the channels of multilateral diplomacy, including the United Nations Environment Program and other international organizations. In the formulation of these elements of United States policy, the ", "Secretary of State shall, under the direction of the President, work jointly with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and other United States agencies concerned with environmental protection, consistent with applicable Federal law.\u201cSEC. 1104. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\u201cNot later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 22, 1987\u201c(1) a summary analysis of current international scientific understanding of the greenhouse effect, including its environmental and health consequences;\u201c(2) an assessment of United States efforts to gain international cooperation in limiting global climate change; and\u201c(3) a description of the strategy by which the United States intends to seek further international cooperation to limit global climate change.\u201cSEC. 1105. INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF GLOBAL CLIMATE PROTECTION.\u201cIn order to focus international attention and concern on the problem of global warming, and to foster further work on multilateral treaties aimed at protecting the global climate, the Secretary of State shall undertake all necessary steps to promote, within the United Nations system, the early designation of an International Year of Global Climate Protection.\u201cSEC. 1106. CLIMATE PROTECTION AND UNITED STATES RELATIONS WITH THE INDEPENDENT STATES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.\u201cIn recognition of the respective leadership roles of the United States and the independent states of the former Soviet Union in the international arena, and of the extent to which they are producers of atmospheric pollutants, the Congress urges that the President accord the problem of climate protection a high priority on the agenda of United States relations with the independent states.\u201dExecutive Documents\nEx.

FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress finds as follows:\u201c(1) There exists evidence that manmade pollution\u2014the release of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and other trace gases into the atmosphere\u2014may be producing a long-term and substantial increase in the average temperature on Earth, a phenomenon known as global warming through the greenhouse effect.\u201c(2) By early in the next century, an increase in Earth temperature could\u2014\u201c(A) so alter global weather patterns as to have an effect on existing agricultural production and on the habitability of large portions of the Earth; and\u201c(B) cause thermal expansion of the oceans and partial melting of the polar ice caps and glaciers, resulting in rising sea levels.\u201c(3) Important research into the problem of climate change is now being conducted by various United States Government and international agencies, and the continuation and intensification of those efforts will be crucial to the development of an effective United States response.\u201c(4) While the consequences of the greenhouse effect may not be fully manifest until the next century, ongoing pollution and deforestation may be contributing now to an irreversible process. Necessary actions must be identified and implemented in time to protect the climate.\u201c(5) The global nature of this problem will require vigorous efforts to achieve international cooperation aimed at minimizing and responding to adverse climate change; such international cooperation will be greatly enhanced by United States leadership. A key step in international cooperation will be the meeting of the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Program, scheduled for June 1989, which will seek to determine a direction for worldwide efforts to control global climate change.\u201c(6) Effective United States leadership in the internation", "al arena will depend upon a coordinated national policy. \u201cSEC. 1103. MANDATE FOR ACTION ON THE GLOBAL CLIMATE.\u201c(a) Goals of United States PolicyUnited States policy should seek to\u2014\u201c(1) increase worldwide understanding of the greenhouse effect and its environmental and health consequences;\u201c(2) foster cooperation among nations to develop more extensive and coordinated scientific research efforts with respect to the greenhouse effect;\u201c(3) identify technologies and activities to limit mankind\u2019s adverse effect on the global climate by\u2014\u201c(A) slowing the rate of increase of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in the near term; and\u201c(B) stabilizing or reducing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases over the long term; and\u201c(4) work toward multilateral agreements.\u201c(b) Formulation of United States PolicyThe President, through the Environmental Protection Agency, shall be responsible for developing and proposing to Congress a coordinated national policy on global climate change. Such policy formulation shall consider research findings of the Committee on Earth Sciences of the Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Engineering Technology, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other organizations engaged in the conduct of scientific research.\u201c(c) Coordination of United States Policy in the International ArenaThe Secretary of State shall be responsible to coordinate those aspects of United States policy requiring action through the channels of multilateral diplomacy, including the United Nations Environment Program and other international organizations. In the formulation of these elements of United States policy, the Secretary of State shall, under the direction of the President, work jointly with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and other United States agencies concerned with env", "ironmental protection, consistent with applicable Federal law. \u201cSEC. 1104. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\u201cNot later than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 22, 1987\u201c(1) a summary analysis of current international scientific understanding of the greenhouse effect, including its environmental and health consequences;\u201c(2) an assessment of United States efforts to gain international cooperation in limiting global climate change; and\u201c(3) a description of the strategy by which the United States intends to seek further international cooperation to limit global climate change. \u201cSEC. 1105. INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF GLOBAL CLIMATE PROTECTION.\u201cIn order to focus international attention and concern on the problem of global warming, and to foster further work on multilateral treaties aimed at protecting the global climate, the Secretary of State shall undertake all necessary steps to promote, within the United Nations system, the early designation of an International Year of Global Climate Protection. \u201cSEC. 1106. CLIMATE PROTECTION AND UNITED STATES RELATIONS WITH THE INDEPENDENT STATES OF THE FORMER SOVIET UNION.\u201cIn recognition of the respective leadership roles of the United States and the independent states of the former Soviet Union in the international arena, and of the extent to which they are producers of atmospheric pollutants, the Congress urges that the President accord the problem of climate protection a high priority on the agenda of United States relations with the independent states.\u201d \u00a7\u202f2902.

Findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) Industrial, agricultural, and other human activities, coupled with an expanding world population, are contributing to processes of global change that may significantly alter the Earth habitat within a few human generations.(2) Such human-induced changes, in conjunction with natural fluctuations, may lead to significant global warming and thus alter world climate patterns and increase global sea levels. Over the next century, these consequences could adversely affect world agricu", "ltural and marine production, coastal habitability, biological diversity, human health, and global economic and social well-being.(3) The release of chlorofluorocarbons and other stratospheric ozone-depleting substances is rapidly reducing the ability of the atmosphere to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation, which could adversely affect human health and ecological systems.(4) Development of effective policies to abate, mitigate, and cope with global change will rely on greatly improved scientific understanding of global environmental processes and on our ability to distinguish human-induced from natural global change.(5) New developments in interdisciplinary Earth sciences, global observing systems, and computing technology make possible significant advances in the scientific understanding and prediction of these global changes and their effects.(6) Although significant Federal global change research efforts are underway, an effective Federal research program will require efficient interagency coordination, and coordination with the research activities of State, private, and international entities.(b) PurposeThe purpose of this subchapter is to provide for development and coordination of a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.(Pub.

Congressional f", "indings(a) The Congress finds that the Nation has suffered substantial unemployment and underemployment, idleness of other productive resources, high rates of inflation, and inadequate productivity growth, over prolonged periods of time, imposing numerous economic and social costs on the Nation. Such costs include the following:(1) The Nation is deprived of the full supply of goods and services, the full utilization of labor and capital resources, and the related increases in economic well-being that would occur under conditions of genuine full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, and the effective control of inflation.(2) The output of goods and services is insufficient to meet pressing national priorities.(3) Workers are deprived of the job security, income, skill development, and productivity necessary to maintain and advance their standards of living.(4) Business and industry are deprived of the production, sales, capital flow, and productivity necessary to maintain adequate profits, undertake new investment, create jobs, compete internationally, and contribute to meeting society\u2019s economic needs. These problems are especially acute for smaller businesses. Variations in the business cycle and low-level operations of the economy are far more damaging to smaller businesses than to larger business concerns because smaller businesses have fewer available resources, and less access to resources, to withstand nationwide economic adversity. A decline in small business enterprises contributes to unemployment by reducing employment opportunities and contributes to inflation by reducing competition.(5) Unemployment exposes many families to social, psychological, and physiological costs, including disruption of family life, loss of individual dignity and self-respect, and the aggravation of physical and psychological illnesses, alcoholism and drug abuse, crime, and social conflicts.(6) Federal, State, and local government budgets are undermined by deficits due to shortfall", "s in tax revenues and in increases in expenditures for unemployment compensation, public assistance, and other recession-related services in the areas of criminal justice, alcoholism and drug abuse, and physical and mental health.(b) The Congress further finds that:(1) High unemployment may contribute to inflation by diminishing labor training and skills, underutilizing capital resources, reducing the rate of productivity advance, increasing unit labor costs, and reducing the general supply of goods and services.(2) Aggregate monetary and fiscal policies alone have been unable to achieve full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance, and reasonable price stability, and therefore must be supplemented by other measures designed to serve these ends.(3) Attainment of these objectives should be facilitated by setting explicit short-term and medium-term economic goals, and by improved coordination among the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.(4) Increasing job opportunities and full employment would greatly contribute to the elimination of discrimination based upon sex, age, race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, or other improper factors.(c) The Congress further finds that an effective policy to promote full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance, and reasonable price stability should (1) be based on the development of explicit economic goals and policies involving the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, with maximum reliance on the resources and ingenuity of the private sector of the economy, (2) include programs specifically designed to reduce high unemployment due to recessions, and to ", "reduce structural unemployment within regional areas and among particular labor force groups, and (3) give proper attention to the role of increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry in providing productive employment opportunities and achieving an improved trade balance.(d) The Congress further finds that full employment and production, increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of an improved trade balance through increased exports and improvement in the international competitiveness of agriculture, business, and industry, and reasonable price stability are important national requirements and will promote the economic security and well-being of all citizens of the Nation.(e) The Congress further finds that the United States is part of an interdependent world trading and monetary system and that attainment of the requirements specified in subsection (d) is dependent upon policies promoting a free and fair international trading system and a sound and stable international monetary system.(Pub.

Congressional findings and purpose(a) The Congress finds and declares that\u2014(1) there is a shortage of adequate and affordable housing throughout the Nation, especially for low- and moderate-income and elderly and handicapped persons;(2) the number of conversions of rental housing to condominiums and cooperatives is accelerating, which in some communities may restrict the shelter options of low- and moderate-income and elderly and handicapped persons;(3) certain long-term leasing arrangements for recreation and other condominium- or cooperative-related facilities which have been used in the formation of cooperative and condominium projects may be unconscionable; in certain situations State governments are unable to provide appropriate relief; as a result of these leases, economic and social hardships may have been imposed upon cooperative and condominium owners, which may threaten the continued use and acceptability of these forms of ownership and interfere with the interstate sale of cooperatives and condominiums; ap", "propriate relief from these abuses requires Federal action; and(4) there is a Federal involvement with the cooperative and condominium housing markets through the operation of Federal tax, housing, and community development laws, through the operation of federally chartered and insured financial institutions, and through other Federal activities; that the creation of many condominiums and cooperatives is undertaken by entities operating on an interstate basis.(b) The purposes of this chapter are to seek to minimize the adverse impacts of condominium and cooperative conversions particularly on the housing opportunities of low- and moderate-income and elderly and handicapped persons, to assure fair and equitable principles are followed in the establishment of condominium and cooperative opportunities, and to provide appropriate relief where long-term leases of recreation and other cooperative- and condominium-related facilities are determined to be unconscionable.(Pub.

Notice of conversion and opportunity to purchase; responsibility of State and local governments\nIt is the sense of the Congress that, when multifamily rental housing projects are converted to condominium or cooperative use, tenants in those projects are entitled to adequate notice of the pending conversion and to receive the first opportunity to purchase units in the converted projects and that State and local governments which have not already provided for such notice and opportunity for purchase should move toward that end.

FindingsThe Congress finds and declares that:(1) Technology and industrial innovation are central to the economic, environmental, and social well-being of citizens of the United States.(2) Technology and industrial innovation offer an improved standard of living, increased public and private sector productivity, creation of new industries and employment opportunities, improved public services and enhanced competitiveness of United States products in world markets.(3) Many new discoveries and advances in science occur in universities and Federal laboratories, while the application of this new knowledge to commercial and useful public purposes depends largely upon actions by business and labor. Cooperation among academia, Federal laboratories, labor, and industry, in such forms as technology transfer, personnel exchange, joint research projects, and others, should be renewed, expanded, and strengthened.(4) Small businesses have performed an important role in advancing industrial and technological innovation.(5) Industrial and technological innovation in the United States may be lagging when compared to historical patterns and other industrialized nations.(6) Increased industrial and technological innovation would reduce trade deficits, stabilize the dollar, increase productivity gains, increase employment, and stabilize prices.(7) Government antitrust, economic, trade, patent, procurement, regulatory, research and development, and tax policies have significant impacts upon industrial innovation and development of technology, but there is insufficient knowledge of their effects in particular sectors of the economy.(8) No comprehensive national policy exists to enhance technological innovation for commercial and public purposes. There is a need for such", " a policy, including a strong national policy supporting domestic technology transfer and utilization of the science and technology resources of the Federal Government.(9) It is in the national interest to promote the adaptation of technological innovations to State and local government uses. Technological innovations can improve services, reduce their costs, and increase productivity in State and local governments.(10) The Federal laboratories and other performers of federally funded research and development frequently provide scientific and technological developments of potential use to State and local governments and private industry. These developments, which include inventions, computer software, and training technologies, should be made accessible to those governments and industry. There is a need to provide means of access and to give adequate personnel and funding support to these means.(11) The Nation should give fuller recognition to individuals and companies which have made outstanding contributions to the promotion of technology or technological manpower for the improvement of the economic, environmental, or social well-being of the United States.(Pub.

Congressional findings and declaration of purpose(a) The Congress finds that\u2014(1) United States exports are responsible for creating and maintaining one out of every nine manufacturing jobs in the United States and for generating one out of every seven dollars of total United States goods produced;(2) the rapidly growing service-related industries are vital to the well-being of the United States economy inasmuch as they create jobs for seven out of every ten Americans, provide 65 per centum of the Nation\u2019s gross national product, and offer the greatest potential for significantly increased industrial trade involving finished products;(3) trade deficits contribute to the decline of the dollar on international currency markets and have an inflationary impact on the United States economy;(4) tens of thousands of small- and medium-sized United States businesses produce exportable goods or services but do not engage in exporting;(5) although the United States is the world\u2019s leading agricultural exporting nation, many farm products are not marketed as widely and effectively abroad as they could be through export trading companies;(6) export trade services in the United States are fragmented into a multitude of separate functions, and companies attempting to offer export trade services lack financial leverage to reach a significant number of potential United States exporters;(7) the United States needs well-developed export trade intermediaries which can achieve economies of scale and acquire expertise enabling them to export goods and services profit", "ably, at low per unit cost to producers;(8) the development of export trading companies in the United States has been hampered by business attitudes and by Government regulations;(9) those activities of State and local governmental authorities which initiate, facilitate, or expand exports of goods and services can be an important source for expansion of total United States exports, as well as for experimentation in the development of innovative export programs keyed to local, State, and regional economic needs;(10) if United States trading companies are to be successful in promoting United States exports and in competing with foreign trading companies, they should be able to draw on the resources, expertise, and knowledge of the United States banking system, both in the United States and abroad; and(11) the Department of Commerce is responsible for the development and promotion of United States exports, and especially for facilitating the export of finished products by United States manufacturers.(b) It is the purpose of this chapter to increase United States exports of products and services by encouraging more efficient provision of export trade services to United States producers and suppliers, in particular by establishing an office within the Department of Commerce to promote the formation of export trade associations and export trading companies, by permitting bank holding companies, bankers\u2019 banks, and Edge Act corporations and agreement corporations that are subsidiaries of bank holding companies to invest in export trading companies, by reducing restrictions on trade financing provided by financial institutions, and by modifying the application of the antitrust laws to certain export trade.(Pub.

No. 13689, Jan. 21, 2015By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the", " United States of America, and to prepare the Nation for a changing Arctic and enhance coordination of national efforts in the Arctic, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyOver the past 60 years, climate change has caused the Alaskan Arctic to warm twice as rapidly as the rest of the United States, and will continue to transform the Arctic as its consequences grow more severe. Over the past several decades, higher atmospheric temperatures have led to a steady and dramatic reduction in Arctic sea ice, widespread glacier retreat, increasing coastal erosion, more acidic oceans, earlier spring snowmelt, thawing permafrost, drier landscapes, and more extensive insect outbreaks and wildfires, thus changing the accessibility and natural features of this remote region. As a global leader, the United States has the responsibility to strengthen international cooperation to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change, understand more fully and manage more effectively the adverse effects of climate change, protect life and property, develop and manage resources responsibly, enhance the quality of life of Arctic inhabitants, and serve as stewards for valuable and vulnerable ecosystems. In doing so, we must rely on science-based decisionmaking and respect the value and utility of the traditional knowledge of Alaska Native peoples. As the United States assumes the Chairmanship of the Arctic Council, it is more important than ever that we have a coordinated national effort that takes advantage of our combined expertise and efforts in the Arctic region to promote our shared values and priorities.As the Arctic has changed, the number of Federal working groups created to address the growing strategic importance and accessibility of this critical region has increased. Although these groups have made significant progress and achieved important milestones, managing the broad range of interagency activity in the Arctic requires coordinated planning by the Federal Government, with input by partners and stakehold", "ers, to facilitate Federal, State, local, and Alaska Native tribal government and similar Alaska Native organization, as well as private and nonprofit sector, efforts in the Arctic.SecArctic Executive Steering Committee(b) Membership(i) the heads, or their designees, of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Domestic Policy Council, and the National Security Council;(ii) the Executive Officer of the Steering Committee, who shall be designated by the Chair of the Steering Committee (Chair); and(iii) the Deputy Secretary or equivalent officer from the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Transportation, Energy, and Homeland Security; the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the National Science Foundation; the Arctic Research Commission; and the Office of Management and Budget; the Assistant to the President for Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs, or his or her designee; and other agencies or offices as determined appropriate by the Chair.(c) Administration.(i) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, or his or her designee, shall be the Chair of the Executive Steering Committee. The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, or his or her designee, shall be the Vice Chair. Under the leadership of the Chair, the Steering Committee will meet quarterly, or as appropriate, to shape priorities, establish strategic direction, oversee implementation, and ensure coordination of Federal activities in the Arctic.(ii) The Steering Committee shall coordinate with existing working groups established by Executive Order or statute.(iii) As appropriate, the Chair of the Steering Committee may establish subcommittees and working groups, consisting of representatives from relevant agencies, to focus on specific key issues and assist in carrying out its responsibiliti", "es.(iv) Agencies shall provide administrative support and additional resources, as appropriate, to support their participation in the Steering Committee to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.

L. 108\u2013237, title I, \u00a7\u202f102June 22, 2004118 Stat. 661\n\u201cThe Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) In 1993, the Congress amended and renamed the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (now known as the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4301Public Law 103\u201342\u201c(2) Subsequently, in 1995, the Congress in enacting the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272Pub. L. 104\u2013113section 3701 of this titleFebruary 18, 1998\u201c(3) Following enactment of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, technical standards developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies have replaced thousands of unique Government standards and specifications allowing the national economy to operate in a more unified fashion.\u201c(4) Having the same technical standards used by Federal agencies and by the private sector permits the Government to avoid the cost of developing duplicative Government standards and to more readily use products and components designed for the commercial marketplace, thereby enhancing quality and safety and reducing costs.\u201c(5) Technical standards are written by hundreds of nonprofit voluntary consensus standards bodies in a nonexclusionary fashion, using thousands of volunteers from the private and public sectors, and are developed under the standards development principles set out in Circular Number A\u2013119, as revised February 18, 1998\u201c(A) notice to all parties known to be affected by the particular standards development activity,\u201c(B) the opportunity to participate in standards development or modification,\u201c(C) balancing interests so that standards development activities are not dominated by any single group of interested persons,\u201c(D) readily available access to essential information regarding proposed and final standards,\u201c(E) the requirement that substantial agreement be reached ", "on all material points after the consideration of all views and objections, and\u201c(F) the right to express a position, to have it considered, and to appeal an adverse decision.\u201c(6) There are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus standards available for government use. Most of these standards are kept current through interim amendments and interpretations, issuance of addenda, and periodic reaffirmation, revision, or reissuance every 3 to 5 years.\u201c(7) Standards developed by government entities generally are not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws.\u201c(8) Private developers of the technical standards that are used as Government standards are often not similarly protected, leaving such developers vulnerable to being named as codefendants in lawsuits even though the likelihood of their being held liable is remote in most cases, and they generally have limited resources to defend themselves in such lawsuits.\u201c(9) Standards development organizations do not stand to benefit from any antitrust violations that might occur in the voluntary consensus standards development process.\u201c(10) As was the case with respect to research and production joint ventures before the passage of the National Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993, if relief from the threat of liability under the antitrust laws is not granted to voluntary consensus standards bodies, both regarding the development of new standards and efforts to keep existing standards current, such bodies could be forced to cut back on standards development activities at great financial cost both to the Government and to the national economy.\u201dPub. L. 103\u201342, \u00a7\u202f2June 10, 1993107 Stat. 117\n\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) technological innovation and its profitable commercialization are critical components of the ability of the United States to raise the living standards of Americans and to compete in world markets;\u201c(2) cooperative arrangements among nonaffiliated businesses in the private sector are often essential for successful technological innovatio", "n; and\u201c(3) the antitrust laws may have been mistakenly perceived to inhibit procompetitive cooperative innovation arrangements, and so clarification serves a useful purpose in helping to promote such arrangements.\u201c(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note above] to promote innovation, facilitate trade, and strengthen the competitiveness of the United States in world markets by clarifying the applicability of the rule of reason standard and establishing a procedure under which businesses may notify the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission of their cooperative ventures and thereby qualify for a single-damages limitation on civil antitrust liability.\u201d \u00a7\u202f4302. Rule of reason standardIn any action under the antitrust laws, or under any State law similar to the antitrust laws, the conduct of\u2014(1) any person in making or performing a contract to carry out a joint venture, or(2) a standards development organization while engaged in a standards development activity,shall not be deemed illegal per se; such conduct shall be judged on the basis of its reasonableness, taking into account all relevant factors affecting competition, including, but not limited to, effects on competition in properly defined, relevant research, development, product, process, and service markets.

FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) A", "dvances in computer science and technology are vital to the Nation\u2019s prosperity, national and economic security, industrial production, engineering, and scientific advancement.(2) The United States currently leads the world in the development and use of networking and information technology, including high-performance computing, for national security, industrial productivity, science, and engineering, but that lead is being challenged by foreign competitors.(3) Further research and development, expanded educational programs, improved computer research networks, and more effective technology transfer from government to industry are necessary for the United States to reap fully the benefits of networking and information technology, including high-performance computing.(4) A high-capacity, flexible, high-speed national research and education computer network is needed to provide researchers and educators with access to computational and information resources, act as a test bed for further research and development for high-capacity and high-speed computer networks, and provide researchers the necessary vehicle for continued network technology improvement through research.(5) Several Federal agencies have ongoing networking and information technology, including high-performance computing, programs, but improved long-term interagency coordination, cooperation, and planning would enhance the effectiveness of these programs.(6) A 1991 report entitled \u201cGrand Challenges: High-Performance Computing and Communications\u201d by the Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlining a research and development strategy for high-performance computing, provides a framework for a multiagency high-performance computing program. Such a program would provide American researchers and educators with the computer and information resources they need, and demonstrate how advanced computers, high-capacity and high-speed networks, and electronic data bases can improve the national information infrastructure for use by all Americans.(7) Additiona", "l research must be undertaken to lay the foundation for the development of new applications that can result in economic growth, improved health care, and improved educational opportunities.(8) Research in new networking technologies holds the promise of easing the economic burdens of information access disproportionately borne by rural users of the Internet.(9) Information security is an important part of computing, information, and communications systems and applications, and research into security architectures is a critical aspect of computing, information, and communications research programs.(Pub.

Ord. No. 13702. Creating a National Strategic Computing InitiativeEx. Ord. No. 13702, July 29, 2015By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to maximize benefits of high-performance computing (HPC) research, development, and deployment, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyOver the past six decades, U.S. computing capabilities have been maintained through continuous research and the development and deployment of new computing systems with rapidly increasing performance on applications of major significance to government, industry, and academia. Maximizing the benefits of HPC in the coming decades will require an effective national response to increasing demands for computing power, emerging technological challenges and opportunities, and growing economic dependency on and competition with other nations. This national response will require a cohesive, strategic effort within the Federal Government and a close collaboration between the public and private sectors.It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance its scientific, technological, and economic leadership position in HPC research, development, and deployment through a coordinated Federal strategy guided by four principles:(1) The United States must deploy and apply new HPC technologies broadly for economic competitiveness and scientific disco", "very.(2) The United States must foster public-private collaboration, relying on the respective strengths of government, industry, and academia to maximize the benefits of HPC.(3) The United States must adopt a whole-of-government approach that draws upon the strengths of and seeks cooperation among all executive departments and agencies with significant expertise or equities in HPC while also collaborating with industry and academia.(4) The United States must develop a comprehensive technical and scientific approach to transition HPC research on hardware, system software, development tools, and applications efficiently into development and, ultimately, operations.This order establishes the NSCI to implement this whole-of-government strategy, in collaboration with industry and academia, for HPC research, development, and deployment.SecObjectives(1) Accelerating delivery of a capable exascale computing system that integrates hardware and software capability to deliver approximately 100 times the performance of current 10 petaflop systems across a range of applications representing government needs.(2) Increasing coherence between the technology base used for modeling and simulation and that used for data analytic computing.(3) Establishing, over the next 15 years, a viable path forward for future HPC systems even after the limits of current semiconductor technology are reached (the \u201cpost-Moore\u2019s Law era\u201d).(4) Increasing the capacity and capability of an enduring national HPC ecosystem by employing a holistic approach that addresses relevant factors such as networking technology, workflow, downward scaling, foundational algorithms and software, accessibility, and workforce development.(5) Developing an enduring public-private collaboration to ensure that the benefits of the research and development advances are, to the greatest extent, shared between the United States Government and industrial and academic sectors.SecRoles and Responsibilities(a) Lead Agencies(b) Foundational Research and Development Agencies(c) Dep", "loyment AgenciesSecExecutive Council(b) The Executive Council shall coordinate and collaborate with the National Science and Technology Council established by Executive Order 12881 of November 23, 1993(c) The Executive Council shall meet regularly to assess the status of efforts to implement this order. The Executive Council shall meet no less often than twice yearly in the first year after issuance of this order. The Executive Council may revise the meeting frequency as needed thereafter. In the event the Executive Council is unable to reach consensus, the Co-Chairs will be responsible for documenting issues and potential resolutions through a process led by OSTP and OMB.(d) The Executive Council will encourage agencies to collaborate with the private sector as appropriate. The Executive Council may seek advice from the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology through the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and may interact with other private sector groups consistent with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.SecImplementation(b) The Co-Chairs shall prepare a report each year until 5 years from the date of this order on the status of the NSCI for the President. After 5 years, reports may be prepared at the discretion of the Co-Chairs.SecDefinitionsThe term \u201chigh-performance computing\u201d refers to systems that, through a combination of processing capability and storage capacity, can solve computational problems that are beyond the capability of small- to medium-scale systems.The term \u201cpetaflop\u201d refers to the ability to perform one quadrillion arithmetic operations per second.The term \u201cexascale computing system\u201d refers to a system operating at one thousand petaflops.SecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of app"]
