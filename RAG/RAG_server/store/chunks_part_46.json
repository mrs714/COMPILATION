Tolerances and exemptions for pesticide chemical residues(a) Requirement for tolerance or exemption(1) General ruleExcept as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), any pesticide chemical residue in or on a food shall be deemed unsafe for the purpose of section 342(a)(2)(B) of this title(A) a tolerance for such pesticide chemical residue in or on such food is in effect under this section and the quantity of the residue is within the limits of the tolerance; or(B) an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is in effect under this section for the pesticide chemical residue.For the purposes of this section, the term \u201cfood\u201d, when used as a noun without modification, shall mean a raw agricultural commodity or processed food.(2) Processed foodNotwithstanding paragraph (1)\u2014(A) if a tolerance is in effect under this section for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a raw agricultural commodity, a pesticide chemical residue that is present in or on a processed food because the food is made from that raw agricultural commodity shall not be considered unsafe within the meaning of section 342(a)(2)(B) of this title(B) if an exemption for the requirement for a", " tolerance is in effect under this section for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a raw agricultural commodity, a pesticide chemical residue that is present in or on a processed food because the food is made from that raw agricultural commodity shall not be considered unsafe within the meaning of section 342(a)(2)(B) of this title(3) Residues of degradation productsIf a pesticide chemical residue is present in or on a food because it is a metabolite or other degradation product of a precursor substance that itself is a pesticide chemical or pesticide chemical residue, such a residue shall not be considered to be unsafe within the meaning of section 342(a)(2)(B) of this title(A) the Administrator has not determined that the degradation product is likely to pose any potential health risk from dietary exposure that is of a different type than, or of a greater significance than, any risk posed by dietary exposure to the precursor substance;(B) either\u2014(i) a tolerance is in effect under this section for residues of the precursor substance in or on the food, and the combined level of residues of the degradation product and the precursor substance in or on the food is at or below the stoichiometrically equivalent level that would be permitted by the tolerance if the residue consisted only of the precursor substance rather than the degradation product; or(ii) an exemption from the need for a tolerance is in effect under this section for residues of the precursor substance in or on the food; and(C) the tolerance or exemption for residues of the precursor substance does not state that it applies only to particular named substances and does not state that it does not apply to residues of the degradation product.(4) Effect of tolerance or exemptionWhile a tolerance or exemption from the requirement for a tolerance is in effect under this section for a pesticide chemical residue with respect to any food, the food shall not by reason of bearing or containing any amount of such a residue be considered to be adulterated within", " the meaning of section 342(a)(1) of this title(b) Authority and standard for tolerance(1) AuthorityThe Administrator may issue regulations establishing, modifying, or revoking a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food\u2014(A) in response to a petition filed under subsection (d); or(B) on the Administrator\u2019s own initiative under subsection (e).As used in this section, the term \u201cmodify\u201d shall not mean expanding the tolerance to cover additional foods.(2) Standard(A) General rule(i) StandardThe Administrator may establish or leave in effect a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food only if the Administrator determines that the tolerance is safe. The Administrator shall modify or revoke a tolerance if the Administrator determines it is not safe.(ii) Determination of safetyAs used in this section, the term \u201csafe\u201d, with respect to a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue, means that the Administrator has determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.(iii) Rule of constructionWith respect to a tolerance, a pesticide chemical residue meeting the standard under clause (i) is not an eligible pesticide chemical residue for purposes of subparagraph (B).(B) Tolerances for eligible pesticide chemical residues(i) DefinitionAs used in this subparagraph, the term \u201celigible pesticide chemical residue\u201d means a pesticide chemical residue as to which\u2014(I) the Administrator is not able to identify a level of exposure to the residue at which the residue will not cause or contribute to a known or anticipated harm to human health (referred to in this section as a \u201cnonthreshold effect\u201d);(II) the lifetime risk of experiencing the nonthreshold effect is appropriately assessed by quantitative risk assessment; and(III) with regard to any known or anticipated harm to human health for which the Administrator is able ", "to identify a level at which the residue will not cause such harm (referred to in this section as a \u201cthreshold effect\u201d), the Administrator determines that the level of aggregate exposure is safe.(ii) Determination of toleranceNotwithstanding subparagraph (A)(i), a tolerance for an eligible pesticide chemical residue may be left in effect or modified under this subparagraph if\u2014(I) at least one of the conditions described in clause (iii) is met; and(II) both of the conditions described in clause (iv) are met.(iii) Conditions regarding useFor purposes of clause (ii), the conditions described in this clause with respect to a tolerance for an eligible pesticide chemical residue are the following:(I) Use of the pesticide chemical that produces the residue protects consumers from adverse effects on health that would pose a greater risk than the dietary risk from the residue.(II) Use of the pesticide chemical that produces the residue is necessary to avoid a significant disruption in domestic production of an adequate, wholesome, and economical food supply.(iv) Conditions regarding riskFor purposes of clause (ii), the conditions described in this clause with respect to a tolerance for an eligible pesticide chemical residue are the following:(I) The yearly risk associated with the nonthreshold effect from aggregate exposure to the residue does not exceed 10 times the yearly risk that would be allowed under subparagraph (A) for such effect.(II) The tolerance is limited so as to ensure that the risk over a lifetime associated with the nonthreshold effect from aggregate exposure to the residue is not greater than twice the lifetime risk that would be allowed under subparagraph (A) for such effect.(v) ReviewFive years after the date on which the Administrator makes a determination to leave in effect or modify a tolerance under this subparagraph, and thereafter as the Administrator deems appropriate, the Administrator shall determine, after notice and opportunity for comment, whether it has been demonstrated to the Administrat", "or that a condition described in clause (iii)(I) or clause (iii)(II) continues to exist with respect to the tolerance and that the yearly and lifetime risks from aggregate exposure to such residue continue to comply with the limits specified in clause (iv). If the Administrator determines by such date that such demonstration has not been made, the Administrator shall, not later than 180 days after the date of such determination, issue a regulation under subsection (e)(1) to modify or revoke the tolerance.(vi) Infants and childrenAny tolerance under this subparagraph shall meet the requirements of subparagraph (C).(C) Exposure of infants and childrenIn establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue, the Administrator\u2014(i) shall assess the risk of the pesticide chemical residue based on\u2014(I) available information about consumption patterns among infants and children that are likely to result in disproportionately high consumption of foods containing or bearing such residue among infants and children in comparison to the general population;(II) available information concerning the special susceptibility of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residues, including neurological differences between infants and children and adults, and effects of in utero exposure to pesticide chemicals; and(III) available information concerning the cumulative effects on infants and children of such residues and other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity; and(ii) shall\u2014(I) ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue; and(II) publish a specific determination regarding the safety of the pesticide chemical residue for infants and children.The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Administrator, shall conduct surveys to document dietary exposure to pesticides among infants and children. In", " the case of threshold effects, for purposes of clause (ii)(I) an additional tenfold margin of safety for the pesticide chemical residue and other sources of exposure shall be applied for infants and children to take into account potential pre- and post-natal toxicity and completeness of the data with respect to exposure and toxicity to infants and children. Notwithstanding such requirement for an additional margin of safety, the Administrator may use a different margin of safety for the pesticide chemical residue only if, on the basis of reliable data, such margin will be safe for infants and children.(D) FactorsIn establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue, the Administrator shall consider, among other relevant factors\u2014(i) the validity, completeness, and reliability of the available data from studies of the pesticide chemical and pesticide chemical residue;(ii) the nature of any toxic effect shown to be caused by the pesticide chemical or pesticide chemical residue in such studies;(iii) available information concerning the relationship of the results of such studies to human risk;(iv) available information concerning the dietary consumption patterns of consumers (and major identifiable subgroups of consumers);(v) available information concerning the cumulative effects of such residues and other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity;(vi) available information concerning the aggregate exposure levels of consumers (and major identifiable subgroups of consumers) to the pesticide chemical residue and to other related substances, including dietary exposure under the tolerance and all other tolerances in effect for the pesticide chemical residue, and exposure from other non-occupational sources;(vii) available information concerning the variability of the sensitivities of major identifiable subgroups of consumers;(viii) such information as the Administrator may require on whether the pesticide chemical may have an effect in humans tha", "t is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen or other endocrine effects; and(ix) safety factors which in the opinion of experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of food additives are generally recognized as appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data.(E) Data and information regarding anticipated and actual residue levels(i) AuthorityIn establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue, the Administrator may consider available data and information on the anticipated residue levels of the pesticide chemical in or on food and the actual residue levels of the pesticide chemical that have been measured in food, including residue data collected by the Food and Drug Administration.(ii) RequirementIf the Administrator relies on anticipated or actual residue levels in establishing, modifying, or leaving in effect a tolerance, the Administrator shall pursuant to subsection (f)(1) require that data be provided five years after the date on which the tolerance is established, modified, or left in effect, and thereafter as the Administrator deems appropriate, demonstrating that such residue levels are not above the levels so relied on. If such data are not so provided, or if the data do not demonstrate that the residue levels are not above the levels so relied on, the Administrator shall, not later than 180 days after the date on which the data were required to be provided, issue a regulation under subsection (e)(1), or an order under subsection (f)(2), as appropriate, to modify or revoke the tolerance.(F) Percent of food actually treatedIn establishing, modifying, leaving in effect, or revoking a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue, the Administrator may, when assessing chronic dietary risk, consider available data and information on the percent of food actually treated with the pesticide chemical (including aggregate pesticide use data collected by the Department of Agriculture) only if the Admi", "nistrator\u2014(i) finds that the data are reliable and provide a valid basis to show what percentage of the food derived from such crop is likely to contain such pesticide chemical residue;(ii) finds that the exposure estimate does not understate exposure for any significant subpopulation group;(iii) finds that, if data are available on pesticide use and consumption of food in a particular area, the population in such area is not dietarily exposed to residues above those estimated by the Administrator; and(iv) provides for the periodic reevaluation of the estimate of anticipated dietary exposure.(3) Detection methods(A) General ruleA tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food shall not be established or modified by the Administrator unless the Administrator determines, after consultation with the Secretary, that there is a practical method for detecting and measuring the levels of the pesticide chemical residue in or on the food.(B) Detection limitA tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food shall not be established at or modified to a level lower than the limit of detection of the method for detecting and measuring the pesticide chemical residue specified by the Administrator under subparagraph (A).(4) International standardsIn establishing a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food, the Administrator shall determine whether a maximum residue level for the pesticide chemical has been established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. If a Codex maximum residue level has been established for the pesticide chemical and the Administrator does not propose to adopt the Codex level, the Administrator shall publish for public comment a notice explaining the reasons for departing from the Codex level.(c) Authority and standard for exemptions(1) AuthorityThe Administrator may issue a regulation establishing, modifying, or revoking an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on food\u2014(A) in response to a petition filed under subsectio", "n (d); or(B) on the Administrator\u2019s initiative under subsection (e).(2) Standard(A) General rule(i) StandardThe Administrator may establish or leave in effect an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on food only if the Administrator determines that the exemption is safe. The Administrator shall modify or revoke an exemption if the Administrator determines it is not safe.(ii) Determination of safetyThe term \u201csafe\u201d, with respect to an exemption for a pesticide chemical residue, means that the Administrator has determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.(B) FactorsIn making a determination under this paragraph, the Administrator shall take into account, among other relevant considerations, the considerations set forth in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of subsection (b)(2).(3) LimitationAn exemption from the requirement for a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on food shall not be established or modified by the Administrator unless the Administrator determines, after consultation with the Secretary\u2014(A) that there is a practical method for detecting and measuring the levels of such pesticide chemical residue in or on food; or(B) that there is no need for such a method, and states the reasons for such determination in issuing the regulation establishing or modifying the exemption.(d) Petition for tolerance or exemption(1) Petitions and petitionersAny person may file with the Administrator a petition proposing the issuance of a regulation\u2014(A) establishing, modifying, or revoking a tolerance for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food; or(B) establishing, modifying, or revoking an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for such a residue.(2) Petition contents(A) EstablishmentA petition under paragraph (1) to establish a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide ", "chemical residue shall be supported by such data and information as are specified in regulations issued by the Administrator, including\u2014(i)(I) an informative summary of the petition and of the data, information, and arguments submitted or cited in support of the petition; and(II) a statement that the petitioner agrees that such summary or any information it contains may be published as a part of the notice of filing of the petition to be published under this subsection and as part of a proposed or final regulation issued under this section;(ii) the name, chemical identity, and composition of the pesticide chemical residue and of the pesticide chemical that produces the residue;(iii) data showing the recommended amount, frequency, method, and time of application of that pesticide chemical;(iv) full reports of tests and investigations made with respect to the safety of the pesticide chemical, including full information as to the methods and controls used in conducting those tests and investigations;(v) full reports of tests and investigations made with respect to the nature and amount of the pesticide chemical residue that is likely to remain in or on the food, including a description of the analytical methods used;(vi) a practical method for detecting and measuring the levels of the pesticide chemical residue in or on the food, or for exemptions, a statement why such a method is not needed;(vii) a proposed tolerance for the pesticide chemical residue, if a tolerance is proposed;(viii) if the petition relates to a tolerance for a processed food, reports of investigations conducted using the processing method(s) used to produce that food;(ix) such information as the Administrator may require to make the determination under subsection (b)(2)(C);(x) such information as the Administrator may require on whether the pesticide chemical may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen or other endocrine effects;(xi) information regarding exposure to the pesticide chemical", " residue due to any tolerance or exemption already granted for such residue;(xii) practical methods for removing any amount of the residue that would exceed any proposed tolerance; and(xiii) such other data and information as the Administrator requires by regulation to support the petition.If information or data required by this subparagraph is available to the Administrator, the person submitting the petition may cite the availability of the information or data in lieu of submitting it. The Administrator may require a petition to be accompanied by samples of the pesticide chemical with respect to which the petition is filed.(B) Modification or revocationThe Administrator may by regulation establish the requirements for information and data to support a petition to modify or revoke a tolerance or to modify or revoke an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance.(3) NoticeA notice of the filing of a petition that the Administrator determines has met the requirements of paragraph (2) shall be published by the Administrator within 30 days after such determination. The notice shall announce the availability of a description of the analytical methods available to the Administrator for the detection and measurement of the pesticide chemical residue with respect to which the petition is filed or shall set forth the petitioner\u2019s statement of why such a method is not needed. The notice shall include the summary required by paragraph (2)(A)(i)(I).(4) Actions by the Administrator(A) In generalThe Administrator shall, after giving due consideration to a petition filed under paragraph (1) and any other information available to the Administrator\u2014(i) issue a final regulation (which may vary from that sought by the petition) establishing, modifying, or revoking a tolerance for the pesticide chemical residue or an exemption of the pesticide chemical residue from the requirement of a tolerance (which final regulation shall be issued without further notice and without further period for public comment);(ii) issue a proposed reg", "ulation under subsection (e), and thereafter issue a final regulation under such subsection; or(iii) issue an order denying the petition.(B) PrioritiesThe Administrator shall give priority to petitions for the establishment or modification of a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue that appears to pose a significantly lower risk to human health from dietary exposure than pesticide chemical residues that have tolerances in effect for the same or similar uses.(C) Expedited review of certain petitions(i) Date certain for reviewIf a person files a complete petition with the Administrator proposing the issuance of a regulation establishing a tolerance or exemption for a pesticide chemical residue that presents a lower risk to human health than a pesticide chemical residue for which a tolerance has been left in effect or modified under subsection (b)(2)(B), the Administrator shall complete action on such petition under this paragraph within 1 year.(ii) Required determinationsIf the Administrator issues a final regulation establishing a tolerance or exemption for a safer pesticide chemical residue under clause (i), the Administrator shall, not later than 180 days after the date on which the regulation is issued, determine whether a condition described in subclause (I) or (II) of subsection (b)(2)(B)(iii) continues to exist with respect to a tolerance that has been left in effect or modified under subsection (b)(2)(B). If such condition does not continue to exist, the Administrator shall, not later than 180 days after the date on which the determination under the preceding sentence is made, issue a regulation under subsection (e)(1) to modify or revoke the tolerance.(e) Action on Administrator\u2019s own initiative(1) General ruleThe Administrator may issue a regulation\u2014(A) establishing, modifying, suspending under subsection (l(B) establishing, modifying, suspending under subsection (l(C) establishing general procedures and requirements to implement this section.(2) NoticeBefore issuing a final regulation u", "nder paragraph (1), the Administrator shall issue a notice of proposed rulemaking and provide a period of not less than 60 days for public comment on the proposed regulation, except that a shorter period for comment may be provided if the Administrator for good cause finds that it would be in the public interest to do so and states the reasons for the finding in the notice of proposed rulemaking.(f) Special data requirements(1) Requiring submission of additional dataIf the Administrator determines that additional data or information are reasonably required to support the continuation of a tolerance or exemption that is in effect under this section for a pesticide chemical residue on a food, the Administrator shall\u2014(A) issue a notice requiring the person holding the pesticide registrations associated with such tolerance or exemption to submit the data or information under section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(2)(B)(B) issue a rule requiring that testing be conducted on a substance or mixture under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act [15 U.S.C. 2603(C) publish in the Federal Register, after first providing notice and an opportunity for comment of not less than 60 days\u2019 duration, an order\u2014(i) requiring the submission to the Administrator by one or more interested persons of a notice identifying the person or persons who will submit the required data and information;(ii) describing the type of data and information required to be submitted to the Administrator and stating why the data and information could not be obtained under the authority of section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(2)(B)15 U.S.C. 2603(iii) describing the reports of the Administrator required to be prepared during and after the collection of the data and information;(iv) requiring the submission to the Administrator of the data, information, and reports referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii); and(v) establishing dates by which th", "e submissions described in clauses (i) and (iv) must be made.The Administrator may under subparagraph (C) revise any such order to correct an error. The Administrator may under this paragraph require data or information pertaining to whether the pesticide chemical may have an effect in humans that is similar to an effect produced by a naturally occurring estrogen or other endocrine effects.(2) NoncomplianceIf a submission required by a notice issued in accordance with paragraph (1)(A), a rule issued under paragraph (1)(B), or an order issued under paragraph (1)(C) is not made by the time specified in such notice, rule, or order, the Administrator may by order published in the Federal Register modify or revoke the tolerance or exemption in question. In any review of such an order under subsection (g)(2), the only material issue shall be whether a submission required under paragraph (1) was not made by the time specified.(g) Effective date, objections, hearings, and administrative review(1) Effective dateA regulation or order issued under subsection (d)(4), (e)(1), or (f)(2) shall take effect upon publication unless the regulation or order specifies otherwise.

L. 100\u2013293, \u00a7\u202f2Apr. 22, 1988102 Stat. 95\n\u201cThe Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) American consumers cannot purchase prescription drugs with the certainty that the products are safe and effective.\u201c(2) The integrity of the distribution system for prescription drugs is insufficient to prevent the introduction and eventual retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or even counterfeit drugs.\u201c(3) The existence and operation of a wholesale submarket, commonly known as the \u2018diversion market\u2019, prevents effective control over or even routine knowledge of the true sources of prescription drugs in a significant number of cases.\u201c(4) Large amounts of drugs are being reimported to the United States as American goods returned. These imports are a health and safety risk to American consumers because they may have become subpotent or adulterated during foreign handling and shipping.\u201c(5) The ready market for prescription drug reimports has been the catalyst for a continuing series of frauds against American manufacturers and has provided the cover for the importation of foreign counterfeit drugs.\u201c(6) The existing system of providing drug samples to physicians through manufacturer\u2019s representatives has been abused for decades and has resulted in the sale to consumers of misbranded, expired, and adulterated pharmaceuticals.\u201c(7) The bulk resale of below wholesale priced prescription drugs by health care entities, for ultimate sale at re", "tail, helps fuel the diversion market and is an unfair form of competition to wholesalers and retailers that must pay otherwise prevailing market prices.\u201c(8) The effect of these several practices and conditions is to create an unacceptable risk that counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, subpotent, or expired drugs will be sold to American consumers.\u201dExecutive Documents\nTransfer of FunctionsFor transfer of functions of Federal Security Administrator to Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare [now Health and Human Services], and of Food and Drug Administration in the Department of Agriculture to Federal Security Agency, see notes set out under section 321 of this title \u00a7\u202f353a.

Regulatory innovation is 1 element of the Nation\u2019s strategy to address serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions by promoting investment in and development of innovative treatments for unmet medical needs.\u201c(B) During the 2 decades following the establishment of the accelerated approval mechanism, advances in medical sciences, including genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, have provided an unprecedented understanding of the underlying biological mechanism and pathogenesis of disease. A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is under development to treat serious and life-threatening diseases, some applying drug development strategies based on biomarkers or pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial enrichment techniques, and novel clinical ", "trial designs, such as adaptive clinical trials.\u201c(C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical advances, the FDA should be encouraged to implement more broadly effective processes for the expedited development and review of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, including those for rare diseases or conditions, using a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle when appropriate. This may result in fewer, smaller, or shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population or targeted subpopulation without compromising or altering the high standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs.\u201c(D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.\u201c(E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act [July 9, 2012\u201c(2) Sense of congressIt is the sense of Congress that the Food and Drug Administration should apply the accelerated approval and fast track provisions set forth in section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356Guidance; Amended RegulationsPub.

Ord. No. 13588. Reducing Prescription Drug ShortagesEx. Ord. No. 13588, Oct. 31, 2011By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyFor example, over approximately the last 5 years, data indicates that the use of sterile injectable ", "cancer treatments has increased by about 20 percent, without a corresponding increase in production capacity. While manufacturers are currently in the process of expanding capacity, it may be several years before production capacity has been significantly increased. Interruptions in the supplies of these drugs endanger patient safety and burden doctors, hospitals, pharmacists, and patients. They also increase health care costs, particularly because some participants in the market may use shortages as opportunities to hoard scarce drugs or charge exorbitant prices.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Department of Health and Human Services has been working diligently to address this problem through its existing regulatory framework. While the root problems and many of their solutions are outside of the FDA\u2019s control, the agency has worked cooperatively with manufacturers to prevent or mitigate shortages by expediting review of certain regulatory submissions and adopting a flexible approach to drug manufacturing and importation regulations where appropriate. As a result, the FDA prevented 137 drug shortages in 2010 and 2011. Despite these successes, however, the problem of drug shortages has continued to grow.Many different factors contribute to drug shortages, and solving this critical public health problem will require a multifaceted approach. An important factor in many of the recent shortages appears to be an increase in demand that exceeds current manufacturing capacity. While manufacturers are in the process of expanding capacity, one important step is ensuring that the FDA and the public receive adequate advance notice of shortages whenever possible. The FDA cannot begin to work with manufacturers or use the other tools at its disposal until it knows there is a potential problem. Similarly, early disclosure of a shortage can help hospitals, doctors, and patients make alternative arrangements before a shortage becomes a crisis. However, drug manufacturers have not consistently provided the FDA with a", "dequate notice of potential shortages.As part of my Administration\u2019s broader effort to work with manufacturers, health care providers, and other stakeholders to prevent drug shortages, this order directs the FDA to take steps that will help to prevent and reduce current and future disruptions in the supply of lifesaving medicines.SecBroader Reporting of Manufacturing Discontinuances21 U.S.C. 356cSecExpedited Regulatory ReviewSecReview of Certain Behaviors by Market ParticipantsSecGeneral Provisions(i) authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f356c\u20131.

Classification of devices intended for human use(a) Classes of devices(1) There are established the following classes of devices intended for human use:(A) Class I, General Controls.\u2014(i) A device for which the controls authorized by or under section 351, 352, 360, 360f, 360h, 360i, or 360j of this title or any combination of such sections are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the de", "vice.(ii) A device for which insufficient information exists to determine that the controls referred to in clause (i) are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device or to establish special controls to provide such assurance, but because it\u2014(I) is not purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, and(II) does not present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury,is to be regulated by the controls referred to in clause (i).(B) Class II, Special ControlsA device which cannot be classified as a class I device because the general controls by themselves are insufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls to provide such assurance, including the promulgation of performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries, development and dissemination of guidelines (including guidelines for the submission of clinical data in premarket notification submissions in accordance with section 360(k) of this title(C) Class III, Premarket ApprovalA device which because\u2014(i) it (I) cannot be classified as a class I device because insufficient information exists to determine that the application of general controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device, and (II) cannot be classified as a class II device because insufficient information exists to determine that the special controls described in subparagraph (B) would provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, and(ii)(I) is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or(II) presents a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury,is to be subject, in accordance with section 360e of thi", "s titleIf there is not sufficient information to establish a performance standard for a device to provide reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness, the Secretary may conduct such activities as may be necessary to develop or obtain such information.(2) For purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of this title, the safety and effectiveness of a device are to be determined\u2014(A) with respect to the persons for whose use the device is represented or intended,(B) with respect to the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device, and(C) weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.(3)(A) Except as authorized by subparagraph (B), the effectiveness of a device is, for purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of this title, to be determined, in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, on the basis of well-controlled investigations, including 1 or more clinical investigations where appropriate, by experts qualified by training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the device, from which investigations it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that the device will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device.(B) If the Secretary determines that there exists valid scientific evidence (other than evidence derived from investigations described in subparagraph (A))\u2014(i) which is sufficient to determine the effectiveness of a device, and(ii) from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that the device will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the device,then, for purposes of this section and sections 360d and 360e of this title, the Secretary may authorize the effectiveness of the device to be de", "termined on the basis of such evidence.(C) In making a determination of a reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of a device for which an application under section 360e of this title(D)(i) The Secretary, upon the written request of any person intending to submit an application under section 360e of this title(ii) Any clinical data, including one or more well-controlled investigations, specified in writing by the Secretary for demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device effectiveness shall be specified as result of a determination by the Secretary that such data are necessary to establish device effectiveness. The Secretary shall consider, in consultation with the applicant, the least burdensome appropriate means of evaluating device effectiveness that would have a reasonable likelihood of resulting in approval.(iii) For purposes of clause (ii), the term \u201cnecessary\u201d means the minimum required information that would support a determination by the Secretary that an application provides reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of the device.(iv) Nothing in this subparagraph shall alter the criteria for evaluating an application for premarket approval of a device.(v) The determination of the Secretary with respect to the specification of valid scientific evidence under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be binding upon the Secretary, unless such determination by the Secretary could be contrary to the public health.(b) Classification panels(1) For purposes of\u2014(A) determining which devices intended for human use should be subject to the requirements of general controls, performance standards, or premarket approval, and(B) providing notice to the manufacturers and importers of such devices to enable them to prepare for the application of such requirements to devices manufactured or imported by them,the Secretary shall classify all such devices (other than devices classified by subsection (f)) into the classes established by subsection (a). For the purpose of securing recommendations with respect to the classification of d", "evices, the Secretary shall establish panels of experts or use panels of experts established before May 28, 1976Section 1013 of title 5(2) The Secretary shall appoint to each panel established under paragraph (1) persons who are qualified by training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the devices to be referred to the panel and who, to the extent feasible, possess skill in the use of, or experience in the development, manufacture, or utilization of, such devices. The Secretary shall make appointments to each panel so that each panel shall consist of members with adequately diversified expertise in such fields as clinical and administrative medicine, engineering, biological and physical sciences, and other related professions. In addition, each panel shall include as nonvoting members a representative of consumer interests and a representative of interests of the device manufacturing industry.

Such diseases and conditions include Huntington\u2019s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease), Tourette syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease, cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\u201c(2) For many years, the 25,000,000 Americans suffering from the over 6,000 rare diseases and disorders were denied access to effective medicines because prescription drug manufacturers could rarely make a profit from marketing drugs for such small groups of patients. The prescr", "iption drug industry did not adequately fund research into such treatments. Despite the urgent health need for these medicines, they came to be known as \u2018orphan drugs\u2019 because no companies would commercialize them.\u201c(3) During the 1970s, an organization called the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) was founded to provide services and to lobby on behalf of patients with rare diseases and disorders. NORD was instrumental in pressing Congress for legislation to encourage the development of orphan drugs.\u201c(4) The Orphan Drug Act [see Short Title of 1983 Amendments note set out under section 301 of this title\u201c(5) Before 1983, some 38 orphan drugs had been developed. Since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act [Jan. 4, 1983\u201c(6) Despite the tremendous success of the Orphan Drug Act, rare diseases and disorders deserve greater emphasis in the national biomedical research enterprise.\u201c(7) The Food and Drug Administration supports small clinical trials through Orphan Products Research Grants. Such grants embody successful partnerships of government and industry, and have led to the development of at least 23 drugs and four medical devices for rare diseases and disorders. Yet the appropriations in fiscal year 2001 for such grants were less than in fiscal year 1995.\u201c(b) PurposesThe purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendments note set out under section 301 of this title \u00a7\u202f360ee\u20131.
