In these hours of need and moments of pain and anxiety, all of us would hope to have a hand to hold, a shoulder on which to lean\u2014a loved one to be there for us, as we would be there for them.Yet every day, all across America, patients are denied the kindnesses and caring of a loved one at their sides\u2014whether in a sudden medical emergency or a prolonged hospital stay. Often, a widow or widower with no children is denied the support and comfort of a good friend. Members of religious orders are sometimes unable to choose someone other than an immediate family member to visit them and make medical decisions on their behalf. Also uniquely affected are gay and lesbian Americans who are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may have spent decades of their lives\u2014unable to be there for the person they love, ", "and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is incapacitated.For all of these Americans, the failure to have their wishes respected concerning who may visit them or make medical decisions on their behalf has real consequences. It means that doctors and nurses do not always have the best information about patients\u2019 medications and medical histories and that friends and certain family members are unable to serve as intermediaries to help communicate patients\u2019 needs. It means that a stressful and at times terrifying experience for patients is senselessly compounded by indignity and unfairness. And it means that all too often, people are made to suffer or even to pass away alone, denied the comfort of companionship in their final moments while a loved one is left worrying and pacing down the hall.Many States have taken steps to try to put an end to these problems. North Carolina recently amended its Patients\u2019 Bill of Rights to give each patient \u201cthe right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient\u2019s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the patient\u201d\u2014a right that applies in every hospital in the State. Delaware, Nebraska, and Minnesota have adopted similar laws.My Administration can expand on these important steps to ensure that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment during their hospital stays. By this memorandum, I request that you take the following steps:1. Initiate appropriate rulemaking, pursuant to your authority under 42 U.S.C. 1395x2. Ensure that all hospitals participating in Medicare or Medicaid are in full compliance with regulations, codified at 42 CFR 482.13 and 42 CFR 489.102(a), promulgated to guarantee that all patients\u2019 advance directives, such as durable powers of attorney and health care proxies, are respected, and that patients\u2019 representatives otherwise have the right to make informed decisions regarding patients\u2019 care. Additionally, I request that you issue new guidelines, pu", "rsuant to your authority under 42 U.S.C. 1395cc3. Provide additional recommendations to me, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, on actions the Department of Health and Human Services can take to address hospital visitation, medical decisionmaking, or other health care issues that affect LGBT patients and their families.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u201cIn promulgating regulations to carry out section 1861(s)(7) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(7)\u201c(1) The ALS intercept services are provided under a contract with one or more volunteer ambulance services and are medically necessary based on the health condition of the individual being transported.\u201c(2) The volunteer ambulance service involved\u2014\u201c(A) is certified as qualified to provide ambulance service for purposes of such section,\u201c(B) provides only basic life support services at the time of the intercept, and\u201c(C) is prohibited by State law from billing for any services.\u201c(3) The entity supplying the ALS intercept services\u2014\u201c(A) is certified as qualified to provide such services under the medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395\u201c(B) bills all recipients who receive ALS intercept services from the entity, regardless of whether or not such recipients are medicare beneficiaries.For purposes of this subsection, an area shall be treated as a rural area if it is designated as a rural area by any law or regulation of the State or if it is located in a rural census tract of a metropolitan statistical area (as determined under the most recent Goldsmith Modification, originally published in the Federal Register on February 27, 1992 \u201cIn establishing limitations under section 1861", "(v)(1)(L) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)July 1, 1986\u201c(1) base such limitations on the most recent data available, which data may be for cost reporting periods beginning no earlier than October 1, 1983\u201c(2) take into account the changes in costs of home health agencies for billing and verification procedures that result from the Secretary\u2019s changing the requirements for such procedures, to the extent the changes in costs are not reflected in such data.Paragraph (2) shall apply to changes in requirements effected before, on, or after July 1, 1986 \u201cAny private, nonprofit health care clinic that\u2014\u201c(1) on July 1, 1977\u201c(2) meets the definition of a rural health clinic under section 1861(aa)(2) [42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(2)l42 U.S.C. 1396dl42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(2)shall be considered, for the purposes of title XVIII or XIX, respectively, of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 \u00a7\u202f1395y.

adjustments under subparagraph (G)(i) for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of residents that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary may adjust unadjusted Federal per diem rates for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.(G) Determination of Federal rateThe Secretary shall compute for each skilled nursing facility for each fiscal year (beginning with the initial period described in subparagraph (E)(i)) an adjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the unadjusted Federal per diem rate determined under subparagraph (E), as adjusted under subparagraph (F), and as further adjusted as follows:(i) Adjustment for case mixThe Secretary shall provide for an appropriate adjustment to account for case mix. Such adjustment shall be based on a resident classification system, established by the Secretary, that accounts for the relative resource utilization of different patient types. The case mix adjustment shall be based on resident assessment data and other data that the Secretary considers appropriate.(ii) Adjustment for geographic variations in labor costsThe Secretary shall adjust the portion of such per diem rate attr", "ibutable to wages and wage-related costs for the area in which the facility is located compared to the national average of such costs using an appropriate wage index as determined by the Secretary. Such adjustment shall be done in a manner that does not result in aggregate payments under this subsection that are greater or less than those that would otherwise be made if such adjustment had not been made.(iii) Adjustment for exclusion of certain additional items and servicesThe Secretary shall provide for an appropriate proportional reduction in payments so that beginning with fiscal year
