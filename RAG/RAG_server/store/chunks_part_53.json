L. 113\u2013150, \u00a7\u202f2Aug. 8, 2014128 Stat. 1807\n\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Sean Goldman, a United States citizen and resident of New Jersey, was abducted from the United States in 2004 and separated from his father, David Goldman, who spent nearly 6 years battling for the return of his son from Brazil before Sean was finally returned to Mr. Goldman\u2019s custody on December 24, 2009\u201c(2) The Department of State\u2019s Office of Children\u2019s Issues, which serves as the Central Authority of the United Stat", "es for the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (referred to in this Act [see Short Title note above] as the \u2018Hague Abduction Convention\u2019), has received thousands of requests since 2007 for assistance in the return to the United States of children who have been wrongfully abducted by a parent or other legal guardian to another country.\u201c(3) For a variety of reasons reflecting the significant obstacles to the recovery of abducted children, as well as the legal and factual complexity involving such cases, not all cases are reported to the Central Authority of the United States.\u201c(4) More than 1,000 outgoing international child abductions are reported every year to the Central Authority of the United States, which depends solely on proactive reporting of abduction cases.\u201c(5) Only about one-half of the children abducted from the United States to countries with which the United States enjoys reciprocal obligations under the Hague Abduction Convention are returned to the United States.\u201c(6) The United States and other Convention countries have expressed their desire, through the Hague Abduction Convention, \u2018to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the State of their habitual residence, as well as to secure protection for rights of access.\u2019\u201c(7) Compliance by the United States and other Convention countries depends on the actions of their designated central authorities, the performance of their judicial systems as reflected in the legal process and decisions rendered to enforce or effectuate the Hague Abduction Convention, and the ability and willingness of their law enforcement authorities to ensure the swift enforcement of orders rendered pursuant to the Hague Abduction Convention.\u201c(8) According to data from the Department of State, approximately 40 percent of abduction cases involve children taken from the United States to countries with which the U", "nited States does not have reciprocal obligations under the Hague Abduction Convention or other arrangements relating to the resolution of abduction cases.\u201c(9) According to the Department of State\u2019s April 2010 Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, \u2018parental child abduction jeopardizes the child and has substantial long-term consequences for both the child and the left-behind parent.\u2019\u201c(10) Few left-behind parents have the extraordinary financial resources necessary\u2014\u201c(A) to pursue individual civil or criminal remedies in both the United States and a foreign country, even if such remedies are available; or\u201c(B) to engage in repeated foreign travel to attempt to obtain the return of their children through diplomatic or other channels.\u201c(11) Military parents often face additional complications in resolving abduction cases because of the challenges presented by their military obligations.\u201c(12) In addition to using the Hague Abduction Convention to achieve the return of abducted children, the United States has an array of Federal, State, and local law enforcement, criminal justice, and judicial tools at its disposal to prevent international abductions.\u201c(13) Federal agencies tasked with preventing international abductions have indicated that the most effective way to stop international child abductions is while they are in progress, rather than after the child has been removed to a foreign destination.\u201c(14) Parental awareness of abductions in progress, rapid response by relevant law enforcement, and effective coordination among Federal, State, local, and international stakeholders are critical in preventing such abductions.\u201c(15) A more robust application of domestic tools, in cooperation with international law enforcement entities and appropriate application of the Hague Abduction Convention could\u2014\u201c(A) discourage some parents from attempting abductions;\u201c(B) block attempted abductions at ports of exit; and\u201c(C) help achieve the return of more abducted children.\u201c", "(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that the United States should set a strong example for other Convention countries in the timely location and prompt resolution of cases involving children abducted abroad and brought to the United States.\u201c(c) PurposesThe purposes of this Act [see Short Title note above] are\u2014\u201c(1) to protect children whose habitual residence is the United States from wrongful abduction;\u201c(2) to assist left-behind parents in quickly resolving cases and maintaining safe and predictable contact with their child while an abduction case is pending;\u201c(3) to protect the custodial rights of parents, including military parents, by providing the parents, the judicial system, and law enforcement authorities with the information they need to prevent unlawful abduction before it occurs;\u201c(4) to enhance the prompt resolution of abduction and access cases;\u201c(5) to detail an appropriate set of actions to be undertaken by the Secretary of State to address persistent problems in the resolution of abduction cases;\u201c(6) to establish a program to prevent wrongful abductions; and\u201c(7) to increase interagency coordination in preventing international child abduction by convening a working group composed of presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed officials from the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice.\u201d \u00a7\u202f9111.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) On February 24, 2022\u201c(2) The international community has condemned the illegal invasions of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, as well as the commission of the crime of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide by officials of the Russian Federation, including through the deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, the forcible transfer of children, and the commission of sexual violence.\u201c(3) The leaders of the G7 have called the Russian Federation\u2019s \u2018unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine\u2019 a \u2018serious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum\u2019.\u201c(4) On March 2, 2022\u201c(5) On March 16, 2022\u201c(6) On November 14, 2022\u201c(A) recognizing that the Russian Federation has committed a serious breach of the most fundamental norms of international law and its gross and systematic refusal to obey its obligations has affected the entire international community;\u201c(B) recognizing the need for the establishment, in cooperation with Ukraine, of an international mechanism for compensation for financially assessable damages caused by the Russian Federation\u2019s internationally wrongful acts; and\u201c(C) recommending \u2018the creation .\u2000.\u2000. of an international register of damage to serve as a record .\u2000.\u2000. of evidence and claims information on damage, loss or injury to all natural and legal persons concerned, as well as the State of Ukraine, caused by internationally wrongful acts of the Russian Federation in or against Ukraine .\u2000\u2026 [sic]\u2019.\u201c(7) The Russian Fe", "deration bears international legal responsibility for its aggression against Ukraine and, under international law, must cease its internationally wrongful acts. Because of this breach of the prohibition on aggression under international law, the United States is legally entitled to take counter measures that are proportionate and aimed at inducing the Russian Federation to comply with its international obligations.\u201c(8) Approximately $300,000,000,000 of Russian sovereign assets have been immobilized worldwide. Only a small fraction of those assets, 1 to 2 percent, or between $4,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000, are reportedly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201c(9) The vast majority of immobilized Russian sovereign assets, approximately $190,000,000,000, are reportedly subject to the jurisdiction of Belgium.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) On February 24, 2022\u201c(2) The international community has condemned the illegal invasions of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, as well as the commission of the crime of aggression, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide by officials of the Russian Federation, including through the deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, the forcible transfer of children, and the commission of sexual violence.\u201c(3) The leaders of the G7 have called the Russian Federation\u2019s \u2018unprovoked and completely unjustified attack on the democratic state of Ukraine\u2019 a \u2018serious violation of international law and a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and all commitments Russia entered in the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris and its commitments in the Budapest Memorandum\u2019.\u201c(4) On March 2, 2022\u201c(5) On March 16, 2022\u201c(6) On November 14, 2022\u201c(A", ") recognizing that the Russian Federation has committed a serious breach of the most fundamental norms of international law and its gross and systematic refusal to obey its obligations has affected the entire international community;\u201c(B) recognizing the need for the establishment, in cooperation with Ukraine, of an international mechanism for compensation for financially assessable damages caused by the Russian Federation\u2019s internationally wrongful acts; and\u201c(C) recommending \u2018the creation .\u2000.\u2000. of an international register of damage to serve as a record .\u2000.\u2000. of evidence and claims information on damage, loss or injury to all natural and legal persons concerned, as well as the State of Ukraine, caused by internationally wrongful acts of the Russian Federation in or against Ukraine .\u2000\u2026 [sic]\u2019.\u201c(7) The Russian Federation bears international legal responsibility for its aggression against Ukraine and, under international law, must cease its internationally wrongful acts. Because of this breach of the prohibition on aggression under international law, the United States is legally entitled to take counter measures that are proportionate and aimed at inducing the Russian Federation to comply with its international obligations.\u201c(8) Approximately $300,000,000,000 of Russian sovereign assets have been immobilized worldwide. Only a small fraction of those assets, 1 to 2 percent, or between $4,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000, are reportedly subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\u201c(9) The vast majority of immobilized Russian sovereign assets, approximately $190,000,000,000, are reportedly subject to the jurisdiction of Belgium.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) The Governm", "ent of the Russian Federation has sought to exert influence throughout Europe and Eurasia, including in the former states of the Soviet Union, by providing resources to political parties, think tanks, and civil society groups that sow distrust in democratic institutions and actors, promote xenophobic and illiberal views, and otherwise undermine European unity. The Government of the Russian Federation has also engaged in well-documented corruption practices as a means toward undermining and buying influence in European and Eurasian countries.(2) The Government of the Russian Federation has largely eliminated a once-vibrant Russian-language independent media sector and severely curtails free and independent media within the borders of the Russian Federation.

Concerns over PDVSA transactions with Rosneft(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) In late 2016, Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petro\u0301leos de Venezuela, S.A. (referred to in this section as \u201cPDVSA\u201d), through a no compete transaction, secured a loan from Russian government-controlled oil company Rosneft, using 49.9 percent of PDVSA\u2019s American subsidiary, CITGO Petroleum Corporation, including its assets in the United States, as collateral. As a result of this transaction, 100 percent of CITGO is held as collateral by PDVSA\u2019s creditors.(2) CITGO, a wholly owned subsidiary of PDVSA, is engaged in interstate commerce and owns and controls critical energy infrastructure in 19 States of the United States, including an extensive network of pipelines, 48 terminals, and 3 refineries, with a combined oil refining capacity of 749,000 barrels per day. CITGO\u2019s refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is the sixth largest refinery in the United States.(3) The Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Rosneft, which is controlled by the Government of the Russ", "ian Federation, and its Executive Chairman, Igor Sechin, following Russia\u2019s military invasion of Ukraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.(4) The Department of Homeland Security has designated the energy sector as critical to United States infrastructure.(5) The growing economic crisis in Venezuela raises the probability that the Maduro regime and PDVSA will default on their international debt obligations, resulting in a scenario in which Rosneft could come into control of CITGO\u2019s United States energy infrastructure holdings.(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that\u2014(1) control of critical United States energy infrastructure by Rosneft, a Russian government-controlled entity currently under United States sanctions that is led by Igor Sechin, who is also under United States sanctions and is a close associate of Vladimir Putin, would pose a significant risk to United States national security and energy security; and(2) a default by PDVSA on its loan from Rosneft, resulting in Rosneft coming into possession of PDVSA\u2019s United States CITGO assets, would warrant careful consideration by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.(c) Preventing Rosneft from controlling United States energy infrastructureThe President shall take all necessary steps to prevent Rosneft from gaining control of critical United States energy infrastructure.(d) Security risk reportNot later than 90 days after December 20, 2019(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;(2) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate;(3) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate;(4) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives;(5) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives; and(6) the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives.(Pub.
