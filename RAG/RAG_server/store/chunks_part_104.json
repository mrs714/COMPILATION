Plan No. 1 of 1977, set out in the Appendix to Title 5, Government Organization and Employees.]Message of the PresidentTo the Congress of the United States:We live in a time when the technology of telecommunications is undergoing rapid change which will dramatically affect the whole of our society. It has long been recognized that the executive branch of the Federal government should be better equipped to deal with the issues which arise from telecommunications growth. As the largest single user of the nation\u2019s telecommunications facilities, the Federal government must also manage its internal communications operations in the most effective manner possible.Accordingly, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.That plan would establish a new Office of Telecommunications Policy in the Executive Office of the ", "President. The new unit would be headed by a Director and a Deputy Director who would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The existing office held by the Director of Telecommunications Management in the Office of Emergency Preparedness would be abolished.In addition to the functions which are transferred to it by the reorganization plan, the new Office would perform certain other duties which I intend to assign to it by Executive order as soon as the reorganization plan takes effect. That order would delegate to the new Office essentially those functions which are now assigned to the Director of Telecommunications Management. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would be assisted in its research and analysis responsibilities by the agencies and departments of the Executive Branch including another new office, located in the Department of Commerce.The new Office of Telecommunications Policy would play three essential roles:1. It would serve as the President\u2019s principal adviser on telecommunications policy, helping to formulate government policies concerning a wide range of domestic and international telecommunications issues and helping to develop plans and programs which take full advantage of the nation\u2019s technological capabilities. The speed of economic and technological advance in our time means that new questions concerning communications are constantly arising, questions on which the government must be well informed and well advised. The new Office will enable the President and all government officials to share more fully in the experience, the insights, and the forecasts of government and non-government experts.2. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would help formulate policies and coordinate operations for the Federal government\u2019s own vast communications systems. It would, for example, set guidelines for the various departments and agencies concerning their communications equipment and services. It would regularly review the ability of government communications ", "systems to meet the security needs of the nation and to perform effectively in time of emergency. The Office would direct the assignment of those portions of the radio spectrum which are reserved for government use, carry out responsibilities conferred on the President by the Communications Satellite Act, advise State and local governments, and provide policy direction for the National Communications System.3. Finally, the new Office would enable the executive branch to speak with a clearer vote and to act as a more effective partner in discussions of communications policy with both the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. This action would take away none of the prerogatives or functions assigned to the Federal Communications Commission by the Congress. It is my hope, however, that the new Office and the Federal Communications Commission would cooperate in achieving certain reforms in telecommunications policy, especially in their procedures for allocating portions of the radio spectrum for government and civilian use. Our current procedures must be more flexible if they are to deal adequately with problems such as the worsening spectrum shortage.Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5The reorganization provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.This plan should result in the more efficient operation of the government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.The public interest requires that government policies concerning telecommunications be formulated with as much sophistication and vision as possible. This reorganization plan\u2014and the exe", "cutive order which would follow it\u2014are necessary instruments if the government is to respond adequately to the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid pace of change in communications. I urge that the Congress allow this plan to become effective so that these necessary reforms can be accomplished.\nRichard Nixon.The White HouseFebruary 9, 1970\nExecutive Order No. 10995Ex. Ord.

L. 107\u2013195, \u00a7\u202f2June 19, 2002116 Stat. 715\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Circumstances in the telecommunications market have changed dramatically since the auctioning of spectrum in the 700 megahertz band was originally mandated by Congress in 1997, raising serious questions as to whether the original deadlines, or the subsequent revision of the deadlines, are consistent with sound telecommunications policy and spectrum management principles.\u201c(2) No comprehensive plan yet exists for allocating additional spectrum for third-generation wireless and other advanced communications services. The Federal Communications Commission should have", " the flexibility to auction frequencies in the 700 megahertz band for such purposes.\u201c(3) The study being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in consultation with the Department of Defense to determine whether the Department of Defense can share or relinquish additional spectrum for third generation wireless and other advanced communications services will not be completed until after the June 19th auction date for the upper 700 megahertz band, and long after the applications must be filed to participate in the auction, thereby creating further uncertainty as to whether the frequencies in the 700 megahertz band will be put to their highest and best use for the benefit of consumers.\u201c(4) The Federal Communications Commission is also in the process of determining how to resolve the interference problems that exist in the 800 megahertz band, especially for public safety. One option being considered for the 800 megahertz band would involve the 700 megahertz band. The Commission should not hold the 700 megahertz auction before the 800 megahertz interference issues are resolved or a tenable plan has been conceived.\u201c(5) The 700 megahertz band is currently occupied by television broadcasters, and will be so until the transfer to digital television is completed. This situation creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty concerning when the spectrum will be available and reduces the value placed on the spectrum by potential bidders. The encumbrance of the 700 megahertz band reduces both the amount of money that the auction would be likely to produce and the probability that the spectrum would be purchased by the entities that valued the spectrum the most and would put the spectrum to its most productive use.\u201c(6) The Commission\u2019s rules governing voluntary mechanisms for vacating the 700 megahertz band by broadcast stations\u2014\u201c(A) produced no certainty that the band would be available for advanced mobile communications services, public safety operations, or other wireless services any earlie", "r than the existing statutory framework provides; and\u201c(B) should advance the transition of digital television and must not result in the unjust enrichment of any incumbent licensee.\u201dCompliance With Auction AuthorityPub.

L. 102\u2013385, \u00a7\u202f2(a)Oct. 5, 1992106 Stat. 1460\n\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds and declares the following:\u201c(1) Pursuant to the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 [Pub. L. 98\u2013549section 611 of this titlesection 2511 of Title 18section 1805 of Title 50December 29, 1986\u201c(2) For a variety of reasons, including local franchising requirements and the extraordinary expense of constructing more than one cable television system to serve a particular geographic area, most cable television subscribers have no opportunity to select between competing cable systems. Without the presence of another multichannel video programming distributor, a cable system faces no local competition. The result is undue market power for the cable operator as compared to that of consumers and video programmers.\u201c(3) There has been a substantial increase in the penetration of cable television systems over the past decade. Nearly 56,000,000 households, over 60 percent of the households with televisions, subscribe to cable television, and this percentage is almost certain to increase. As a result of this growth, the cable television industry ha", "s become a dominant nationwide video medium.\u201c(4) The cable industry has become highly concentrated. The potential effects of such concentration are barriers to entry for new programmers and a reduction in the number of media voices available to consumers.\u201c(5) The cable industry has become vertically integrated; cable operators and cable programmers often have common ownership. As a result, cable operators have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated programmers. This could make it more difficult for noncable-affiliated programmers to secure carriage on cable systems. Vertically integrated program suppliers also have the incentive and ability to favor their affiliated cable operators over nonaffiliated cable operators and programming distributors using other technologies.\u201c(6) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in promoting a diversity of views provided through multiple technology media.\u201c(7) There is a substantial governmental and First Amendment interest in ensuring that cable subscribers have access to local noncommercial educational stations which Congress has authorized, as expressed in section 396(a)(5) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 396(a)(5)\u201c(8) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in making all nonduplicative local public television services available on cable systems because\u2014\u201c(A) public television provides educational and informational programming to the Nation\u2019s citizens, thereby advancing the Government\u2019s compelling interest in educating its citizens;\u201c(B) public television is a local community institution, supported through local tax dollars and voluntary citizen contributions in excess of $10,800,000,000 since 1972, that provides public service programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of the local community;\u201c(C) the Federal Government, in recognition of public television\u2019s integral role in serving the educational and informational needs of local communities, has invested more than $3,000,000,000 in public broadcasting ", "since 1969; and\u201c(D) absent carriage requirements there is a substantial likelihood that citizens, who have supported local public television services, will be deprived of those services.\u201c(9) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in having cable systems carry the signals of local commercial television stations because the carriage of such signals is necessary to serve the goals contained in section 307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 307(b)\u201c(10) A primary objective and benefit of our Nation\u2019s system of regulation of television broadcasting is the local origination of programming. There is a substantial governmental interest in ensuring its continuation.\u201c(11) Broadcast television stations continue to be an important source of local news and public affairs programming and other local broadcast services critical to an informed electorate.\u201c(12) Broadcast television programming is supported by revenues generated from advertising broadcast over stations. Such programming is otherwise free to those who own television sets and do not require cable transmission to receive broadcast signals. There is a substantial governmental interest in promoting the continued availability of such free television programming, especially for viewers who are unable to afford other means of receiving programming.\u201c(13) As a result of the growth of cable television, there has been a marked shift in market share from broadcast television to cable television services.\u201c(14) Cable television systems and broadcast television stations increasingly compete for television advertising revenues. As the proportion of households subscribing to cable television increases, proportionately more advertising revenues will be reallocated from broadcast to cable television systems.\u201c(15) A cable television system which carries the signal of a local television broadcaster is assisting the broadcaster to increase its viewership, and thereby attract additional advertising revenues that otherwise might be earned by the cable system operato", "r. As a result, there is an economic incentive for cable systems to terminate the retransmission of the broadcast signal, refuse to carry new signals, or reposition a broadcast signal to a disadvantageous channel position. There is a substantial likelihood that absent the reimposition of such a requirement, additional local broadcast signals will be deleted, repositioned, or not carried.\u201c(16) As a result of the economic incentive that cable systems have to delete, reposition, or not carry local broadcast signals, coupled with the absence of a requirement that such systems carry local broadcast signals, the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously jeopardized.\u201c(17) Consumers who subscribe to cable television often do so to obtain local broadcast signals which they otherwise would not be able to receive, or to obtain improved signals. Most subscribers to cable television systems do not or cannot maintain antennas to receive broadcast television services, do not have input selector switches to convert from a cable to antenna reception system, or cannot otherwise receive broadcast television services. The regulatory system created by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 was premised upon the continued existence of mandatory carriage obligations for cable systems, ensuring that local stations would be protected from anticompetitive conduct by cable systems.\u201c(18) Cable television systems often are the single most efficient distribution system for television programming. A Government mandate for a substantial societal investment in alternative distribution systems for cable subscribers, such as the \u2018A/B\u2019 input selector antenna system, is not an enduring or feasible method of distribution and is not in the public interest.\u201c(19) At the same time, broadcast programming that is carried remains the most popular programming on cable systems, and a substantial portion of the benefits for which consumers pay cable systems is derived fro", "m carriage of the signals of network affiliates, independent television stations, and public television stations. Also cable programming placed on channels adjacent to popular off-the-air signals obtains a larger audience than on other channel positions. Cable systems, therefore, obtain great benefits from local broadcast signals which, until now, they have been able to obtain without the consent of the broadcaster or any copyright liability. This has resulted in an effective subsidy of the development of cable systems by local broadcasters. While at one time, when cable systems did not attempt to compete with local broadcasters for programming, audience, and advertising, this subsidy may have been appropriate, it is so no longer and results in a competitive imbalance between the 2 industries.\u201c(20) The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, in its amendments to the Communications Act of 1934 [47 U.S.C. 151\u201c(21) Cable systems should be encouraged to carry low-power television stations licensed to the communities served by those systems where the low-power station creates and broadcasts, as a substantial part of its programming day, local programming.\u201c(b) Statement of PolicyIt is the policy of the Congress in this Act [enacting sections 334, 335, 534 to 537, 544a, 548, and 555a of this title, amending sections 325, 332, 522, 532, 533, 541 to 544, 546, 551 to 555, and 558 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and sections 325, 531, 543, and 554 of this title] to\u2014\u201c(1) promote the availability to the public of a diversity of views and information through cable television and other video distribution media;\u201c(2) rely on the marketplace, to the maximum extent feasible, to achieve that availability;\u201c(3) ensure that cable operators continue to expand, where economically justified, their capacity and the programs offered over their cable systems;\u201c(4) where cable television systems are not subject to effective competition, ensure that consumer interests are protected in receipt of cable", " service; and\u201c(5) ensure that cable television operators do not have undue market power vis-a-vis video programmers and consumers.\u201dSports Programming Migration Study and ReportPub.

Consumer electronics equipment compatibility(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) new and recent models of television receivers and video cassette recorders often contain premium features and functions that are disabled or inhibited because of cable scrambling, encoding, or encryption technologies and devices, including converte", "r boxes and remote control devices required by cable operators to receive programming;(2) if these problems are allowed to persist, consumers will be less likely to purchase, and electronics equipment manufacturers will be less likely to develop, manufacture, or offer for sale, television receivers and video cassette recorders with new and innovative features and functions;(3) cable operators should use technologies that will prevent signal thefts while permitting consumers to benefit from such features and functions in such receivers and recorders; and(4) compatibility among televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems can be assured with narrow technical standards that mandate a minimum degree of common design and operation, leaving all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options for selection through open competition in the market.(b) Compatible interfaces(1) RegulationsThe Commission shall issue such regulations as are necessary to assure compatibility between televisions and video cassette recorders and cable systems, consistent with the need to prevent theft of cable service, so that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefit of both the programming available on cable systems and the functions available on their televisions and video cassette recorders.(2) Scrambling and encryptionIn issuing the regulations referred to in paragraph (1), the Commission shall determine whether and, if so, under what circumstances to permit cable systems to scramble or encrypt signals or to restrict cable systems in the manner in which they encrypt or scramble signals, except that the Commission shall not limit the use of scrambling or encryption technology where the use of such technology does not interfere with the functions of subscribers\u2019 television receivers or video cassette recorders.(c) Rulemaking requirements(1) Factors to be consideredIn prescribing the regulations required by this section, the Commission shall consider\u2014(A) the need to maximize open competition in t", "he market for all features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options of converter boxes and other cable converters unrelated to the descrambling or decryption of cable television signals;(B) the costs and benefits to consumers of imposing compatibility requirements on cable operators and television manufacturers in a manner that, while providing effective protection against theft or unauthorized reception of cable service, will minimize interference with or nullification of the special functions of subscribers\u2019 television receivers or video cassette recorders, including functions that permit the subscriber\u2014(i) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;(ii) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and(iii) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and(C) the need for cable operators to protect the integrity of the signals transmitted by the cable operator against theft or to protect such signals against unauthorized reception.(2) Regulations requiredThe regulations prescribed by the Commission under this section shall include such regulations as are necessary\u2014(A) to specify the technical requirements with which a television receiver or video cassette recorder must comply in order to be sold as \u201ccable compatible\u201d or \u201ccable ready\u201d;(B) to require cable operators offering channels whose reception requires a converter box\u2014(i) to notify subscribers that they may be unable to benefit from the special functions of their television receivers and video cassette recorders, including functions that permit subscribers\u2014(I) to watch a program on one channel while simultaneously using a video cassette recorder to tape a program on another channel;(II) to use a video cassette recorder to tape two consecutive programs that appear on different channels; and(III) to use advanced television picture generation and display features; and(ii) to the exten", "t technically and economically feasible, to offer subscribers the option of having all other channels delivered directly to the subscribers\u2019 television receivers or video cassette recorders without passing through the converter box;(C) to promote the commercial availability, from cable operators and retail vendors that are not affiliated with cable systems, of converter boxes and of remote control devices compatible with converter boxes;(D) to ensure that any standards or regulations developed under the authority of this section to ensure compatibility between televisions, video cassette recorders, and cable systems do not affect features, functions, protocols, and other product and service options other than those specified in paragraph (1)(B), including telecommunications interface equipment, home automation communications, and computer network services;(E) to require a cable operator who offers subscribers the option of renting a remote control unit\u2014(i) to notify subscribers that they may purchase a commercially available remote control device from any source that sells such devices rather than renting it from the cable operator; and(ii) to specify the types of remote control units that are compatible with the converter box supplied by the cable operator; and(F) to prohibit a cable operator from taking any action that prevents or in any way disables the converter box supplied by the cable operator from operating compatibly with commercially available remote control units.(d) Review of regulationsThe Commission shall periodically review and, if necessary, modify the regulations issued pursuant to this section in light of any actions taken in response to such regulations and to reflect improvements and changes in cable systems, television receivers, video cassette recorders, and similar technology.(June 19, 1934, ch. 652Pub.

With respect to a Federal program or activity for which no fiscal baseline has been established, this memorandum shall not be construed to require that such program or activity be conducted in a way that increases or decreases Federal receipts or expenditures relative to the level that would obtain if Puerto Rico were treated other than as a State.If any matters arise involving the fundamentals of Puerto Rico\u2019s status, they shall be referred to the Office of the President.This guidance shall remain in effect until Federal legislation is enacted altering the current status of Puerto Rico in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of Puerto Rico.The memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies on this subject, issued July 25, 1961This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.\nGeorge Bush. \u00a7\u202f734a.
