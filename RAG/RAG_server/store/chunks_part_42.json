As of 2015, exports from Nepal are approximately $800,000,000 per year, with India the major market at $450,000,000 annually. The United States imports about $80,000,000 worth of goods from Nepal, or 10 percent of the total goods exported from Nepal.(B) The World Bank has found evidence that the overall export competitiveness of Nepal has been declining since 2005. Indices compiled by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development found that export costs in Nepal are high with respect to both air cargo and container shipments relative to other low-income countries. Such indices also identify particular weaknesses in Nepal with respect to automation of customs and other trade functions, involvement of local exporters and importers in preparing regulations and trade rules, and export finance.(C) Implementation by Nepal of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade Organization could directly address some of the weaknesses described in subparagraph (B).(2) Establishment of trade facilitation and capacity building programNot later than 180 days after February 24, 2016(A) to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal to support successful exporters and to build awareness among potential exporters in Nepal about op", "portunities abroad and ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the United States and other countries;(B) to provide export finance training for financial institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal;(C) to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining publication on the Internet of all trade regulations, forms for exporters and importers, tax and tariff rates, and other documentation relating to exporting goods and developing a robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade Organization; and(D) to increase access to guides for importers and exporters, through publication of such guides on the Internet, including rules and documentation for United States tariff preference programs.(e) Reporting requirementNot later than one year after February 24, 2016(f) Termination of preferential treatmentNo preferential treatment extended under this section shall remain in effect after December 31, 2025(g) Effective dateThe provisions of this section shall take effect on the date that is 30 days after February 24, 2016(Pub.

Findings; purpose(a) FindingsCongress finds as follows:(1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and fight for justice.(2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil Rights movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a shining example of this principle in action, demonstrated in events as varied as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the drive for voting rights in Mississippi, and the March to Selma.(3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible leaders, including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks, there were many others whose impact and experience were just as important to the cause but who are not as well known.(4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess an invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the movement, and the recording of the retelling of their stories and memories ", "will provide a rich, detailed history of our Nation during an important and tumultuous period.(5) It is in the Nation\u2019s interest to undertake a project to collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil Rights movement so future generations will be able to learn of their struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, eyewitness material. A coordinated Federal project would also focus attention on the efforts undertaken by various public and private entities to collect and interpret articles in all formats relating to the Civil Rights movement, and serve as a model for future projects undertaken in museums, libraries, and universities throughout the Nation.(6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution are appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make available to the public a collection of these oral histories. The Library and Smithsonian have expertise in the management of documentation projects, and experience in the development of cultural and educational programs for the public.(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this subchapter to create a new federally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will coordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights movement that will build upon and complement previous and ongoing documentary work on this subject, and to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of such individuals so that Americans of all current and future generations may hear from them directly and better appreciate the sacrifices they made.(Pub.

FindingsCongress finds the following:(1) Since its founding, the United States has greatly benefitted from the contributions of women.(2) Historical accounts, monuments, memorials, and museums disproportionately represent men\u2019s achievements and contributions and often neglect those of women. For example\u2014(A) a study of 18 United States history textbooks concluded that 10 percent of the material documented contributions of women;(B) 9 statues out of 91 in the United States Capitol\u2019s National Statuary Hall depict women; and(C) only one of the 44 monuments operated by the National Park Service specifically honors the achievements of women after the 2016 designation of the Belmont-Paul Women\u2019s Equality National Monument.(3) There exists no national museum in the United States that is devoted to the documentation of women\u2019s contributions throughout the Nation\u2019s history.(4) On December 19, 2014(5) A comprehensive women\u2019s history museum would document the full spectrum of the experiences of women in the United States, represent a diverse range of viewpoints, experiences, and backgrounds, more accurately depict the history of the United States, and add value to the Smithsonian Institution.(6) The collections, exhibits, historical narrative materials, and museum programming of the women\u2019s history museum should be inclusive, comprehensive, and innovative. Such collections, exhibits, materials, and programming should present the diverse range of experiences and viewpoints of all women in the United States, reflecting upon the things that set women apart from one another while also highlighting the experiences that many of these women share.(Pub.

That statutory responsibility is now conducted by the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia [now the Mayor].Under the accompanying reorganization plan, the responsibility for the preparation of these plans and specifications would be transferred from the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners to the Smithsonian. The complete administration of the park would then be vested in one agency\u2014the Smithsonian Institution. This will allow the more efficient and effective development and management of the park.In 1912, the functions to be transferred were vested in the Municipal Architect of the District of Columbia and in the Engineers of the Bridges of the District of Columbia. In 1952, they were transferred to the Board of Commissioners.When the 1912 act was passed, the District of Columbia shared the costs of capital improvements in the National Zoological Park. In 1961, it ceased sharing these costs, and the Federal Government assumed complete responsibility for financing the improvements. Accordingly, the District government retains no capital improvement responsibilities for the National Zoological Park except those functions relating to construction plans and specifications for buildings and bridges, as specified in the 1912 statute. Upon the transfer of these remaining functions to the Smithsonian Institution, the administration of the National Zoological Park will, at last", ", be fully centered in one agency. It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the resulting reduction in expenditures.I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.\nLyndon B.

(A) Such appropriation shall be expended by the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind each year in manufacturing and furnishing books and other materials specially adapted for instruction of the blind; and the total amount of such books and other materials so manufactured and furnished by such appropriation shall each year be distributed among all the public and private nonprofit institutions in the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, in which blind pupils are educated. Each public and private nonprofit institution for the education of the blind shall receive, in books and other materials, upon requisition of its superintendent, that portion of the appropriation as is shown by the ratio between the number of blind pupils in that institution and the total number of blind pupils in all of the public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated. Each chief State school officer shall receive, in books and other materials, upon requisition, that portion of the appropriation as is shown by the ratio between the number of blind pupils in public and private nonprofit institutions (in the State) in which blind pupils are educated, other than institutions to which the preceding sentence is applicable, and the total number of blind pupils in the public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated in all of the States, Territories, a", "nd possessions of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. The ratio referred to in each of the two immediately preceding sentences shall be computed upon the first Monday in January of each year; and for purposes of such sentences the number of blind pupils in public and private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated shall be authenticated in such manner and as often as the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind shall require. For purposes of sections 101, 102, and 104 of this title, an institution for the education of the blind is any institution which provides education exclusively for the blind, or exclusively for the blind and other handicapped children (in which case special classes are provided for the blind); the chief State school officer of a State is the superintendent of public elementary and secondary schools in such State or, if there is none, such other official as the Governor certifies to have comparable responsibility in the State; and a blind pupil is a blind individual pursuing a course of study in an institution of less than college grade.(B) The portion of the appropriation received by each chief State school officer, in such books and other materials under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph which represents the number of blind pupils in private nonprofit institutions in such State in which blind pupils are educated shall be distributed among such institutions on the basis of the number of blind pupils in each such institution as compared to the total number of such pupils in all of the private nonprofit institutions in which blind pupils are educated in such State.(C) All books and other materials furnished pursuant to sections 101, 102, and 104 of this title, and control and administration of their use, shall vest only in a public agency. Such books and materials made available pursuant to sections 101, 102 and 104 of this title for use of teachers and blind pupils in any State, Territory, or possession of the Unite", "d States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia in any school shall be limited to those books and materials which have been approved by an appropriate educational authority or agency of such State, Territory, possession, Commonwealth, or District, or any local educational authority thereof, for use, or are used, in a public elementary or secondary school therein.(2) BuildingsSecond. No part of the appropriation shall be expended in the erection or leasing of buildings; but the trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind may use each year a reasonable sum of the annual appropriation for salaries and other expenses of experts and other staff to assist special committees which may be appointed in performance of their functions, and for expenses of such special committees.(3) Sales of books and apparatus at costThird. No profit shall be put on any books or tangible apparatus for the instruction of the blind manufactured or furnished by the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky; and the price put upon each article so manufactured or furnished shall only be its actual cost.(4) Income withheld when not properly usedFourth. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States shall have the authority to withhold the appropriation whenever he shall receive satisfactory proof that the trustees of said American Printing House for the Blind, located in Louisville, Kentucky, are not using the appropriation for the benefit of the blind in the public and private nonprofit institutions for the education of the blind in the United States.(5) Bond of treasurerFifth. Before any money be paid to the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, the treasurer of the American Printing House for the Blind shall execute a bond, with two approved sureties, to the amount of $20,000, conditioned that the money so received shall be expended according to this law and all amendments thereto, which s", "hall be held by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, and shall be renewed every two years.(6) Ex officio trusteesSixth. The superintendent of each public institution for the education of the blind (or his designee) and the chief State school officer (or his designee), of each State and possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, shall each, ex officio, be a member of the Board of Trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind only for purposes of administering sections 101, 102 and 104 of this title.(Mar. 3, 1879, ch. 186, \u00a7\u202f320 Stat. 468June 25, 1906, ch. 353634 Stat. 460Aug. 2, 1956, ch. 882, \u00a7\u202f170 Stat. 938Pub.

Through the Federal Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program administered by the Department of Education, talented and creative individuals who are blind have acquired the management training and business skills necessary to realize the American dream\u2014a lifetime of economic opportunity, independence, and self-sufficiency for themselves and their families.For 75 years, blind business managers have successfully operated food services and commercial ventures at Federal, State, and private buildings and locations nationwide. We honor and celebrate this program\u2019s historic achievements. We also trust that the Randolph-Sheppard Program will continue to be a leading model for providing high-quality entrepreneurial opportunities for blind individuals. From a simple snack shop, to tourist services at the Hoover", " Dam, to full food-services operations at military installations, blind entrepreneurs have provided exceptional customer service to Federal and State employees, the Armed Forces, and the general public. With proven ability, they have challenged preconceived notions about disability.The Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107et seqContinued support and cooperation are needed from executive departments, agencies, and offices (agencies) to extend the Randolph-Sheppard priority to qualified blind managers through the State licensing agencies that implement the program. Therefore, I direct all agencies that have property management responsibilities to ensure that agency officials, when pursuing the establishment and operation of vending facilities (including cafeterias and military dining facilities) as defined in 20 U.S.C. 107eThis memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Secretary of Education is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f107b.

Declaration of findings and purposesThe Congress finds and declares the following:(1) The arts and the humanities belong to all the people of the United States.(2) The encouragement and support of national progress and scholarship in the humanities and the arts, while primarily a m", "atter for private and local initiative, are also appropriate matters of concern to the Federal Government.(3) An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone, but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.(4) Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens. It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.(5) It is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to complement, assist, and add to programs for the advancement of the humanities and the arts by local, State, regional, and private agencies and their organizations. In doing so, the Government must be sensitive to the nature of public sponsorship. Public funding of the arts and humanities is subject to the conditions that traditionally govern the use of public money. Such funding should contribute to public support and confidence in the use of taxpayer funds. Public funds provided by the Federal Government must ultimately serve public purposes the Congress defines.(6) The arts and the humanities reflect the high place accorded by the American people to the nation\u2019s rich cultural heritage and to the fostering of mutual respect for the diverse beliefs and values of all persons and groups.(7) The practice of art and the study of the humanities require constant dedication and devotion. While no government can call a great artist or scholar into existence, it is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to help create and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, and inquiry but also the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent.(8) The world leadership which has come to the United States cannot rest s", "olely upon superior power, wealth, and technology, but must be solidly founded upon worldwide respect and admiration for the Nation\u2019s high qualities as a leader in the realm of ideas and of the spirit.(9) Americans should receive in school, background and preparation in the arts and humanities to enable them to recognize and appreciate the aesthetic dimensions of our lives, the diversity of excellence that comprises our cultural heritage, and artistic and scholarly expression.(10) It is vital to a democracy to honor and preserve its multicultural artistic heritage as well as support new ideas, and therefore it is essential to provide financial assistance to its artists and the organizations that support their work.(11) To fulfill its educational mission, achieve an orderly continuation of free society, and provide models of excellence to the American people, the Federal Government must transmit the achievement and values of civilization from the past via the present to the future, and make widely available the greatest achievements of art.(12) In order to implement these findings and purposes, it is desirable to establish a National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities.(Pub.

Improvin", "g Free Inquiry, Transparency, and Accountability at Colleges and UniversitiesEx. Ord. No. 13864, Mar. 21, 2019By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1PurposeIn particular, my Administration seeks to promote free and open debate on college and university campuses. Free inquiry is an essential feature of our Nation\u2019s democracy, and it promotes learning, scientific discovery, and economic prosperity. We must encourage institutions to appropriately account for this bedrock principle in their administration of student life and to avoid creating environments that stifle competing perspectives, thereby potentially impeding beneficial research and undermining learning.The financial burden of higher education on students and their families is also a national problem that needs immediate attention. Over the past 30 years, college tuition and fees have grown at more than twice the rate of the Consumer Price Index. Rising student loan debt, coupled with low repayment rates, threatens the financial health of both individuals and families as well as of Federal student loan programs. In addition, too many programs of study fail to prepare students for success in today\u2019s job market.The Federal Government can take meaningful steps to address these problems. Selecting an institution and course of study are important decisions for prospective students and significantly affect long-term earnings. Institutions should be transparent about the average earnings and loan repayment rates of former students who received Federal student aid. Additionally, the Federal Government should make this information readily accessible to the public and to prospective students and their families, in particular.This order will promote greater access to critical information regarding the prices and outcomes of postsecondary education, thereby furthering the goals of the National Council for the American Worker established by Executive Order 1384", "5 of July 19, 201829 U.S.C. 3101SecPolicy(a) encourage institutions to foster environments that promote open, intellectually engaging, and diverse debate, including through compliance with the First Amendment for public institutions and compliance with stated institutional policies regarding freedom of speech for private institutions;(b) help students (including workers seeking additional training) and their families understand, through better data and career counseling, that not all institutions, degrees, or fields of study provide similar returns on their investment, and consider that their educational decisions should account for the opportunity cost of enrolling in a program;(c) align the incentives of institutions with those of students and taxpayers to ensure that institutions share the financial risk associated with Federal student loan programs;(d) help borrowers avoid defaulting on their Federal student loans by educating them about risks, repayment obligations, and repayment options; and(e) supplement efforts by States and institutions by disseminating information to assist students in completing their degrees faster and at lower cost.SecImproving Free Inquiry on Campus(b) \u201cCovered agencies\u201d for purposes of this section are the Departments of Defense, the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Transportation, Energy, and Education; the Environmental Protection Agency; the National Science Foundation; and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.(c) \u201cFederal research or education grants\u201d for purposes of this section include all funding provided by a covered agency directly to an institution but do not include funding associated with Federal student aid programs that cover tuition, fees, or stipends.SecImproving Transparency and Accountability on Campus(i) make available, by January 1, 2020(ii) expand and update annually the College Scorecard, or any successor, with the following program-level data for each certificate, degree, graduate, and professional program, for f", "ormer students who received Federal student aid:(A) estimated median earnings;(B) median Stafford loan debt;(C) median Graduate PLUS loan debt (if applicable);(D) median Parent PLUS loan debt; and(E) student loan default rate and repayment rate; and(iii) expand and update annually the College Scorecard, or any successor, with the following institution-level data, providing the aggregate for all certificate, degree, graduate, and professional programs, for former students who received Federal student aid:(A) student loan default rate and repayment rate;(B) Graduate PLUS default rate and repayment rate; and(C) Parent PLUS default rate and repayment rate.(b) For the purpose of implementing subsection (a)(ii) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, upon the request of the Secretary, provide in a timely manner appropriate statistical studies and compilations regarding program-level earnings, consistent with section 6108(b) of title 26SecReporting RequirementsJanuary 1, 2020(b) By January 1, 2020(c) Beginning July 1, 2019(d) Within 1 year of the date of this order [Mar. 21, 2019(i) how some States and institutions have better facilitated successful transfer of credits and degree completion by transfer students;(ii) how States and institutions can increase access to dual enrollment programs; and(iii) other strategies for increasing student success, especially among students at high risk of not completing a postsecondary program of study.SecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or ent", "ities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDonald J.

Findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) there are a significant number of institutions of higher education serving high percentages of minority students and students from low-income backgrounds, that face problems that threaten their ability to survive;(2) the problems relate to the management and fiscal operations of certain institutions of higher education, as well as to an inability to engage in long-range planning and development activities, including endowment building;(3) in order to be competitive and provide a high-quality education for all, institutions of higher education should improve their technological capacity and make effective use of technology;(4) the subchapter III program prior to 1985 did not always meet the specific development needs of ", "historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions with large concentrations of minority, low-income students;(5) the solution of the problems of these institutions would enable them to become viable, fiscally stable and independent, thriving institutions of higher education;(6) providing assistance to eligible institutions will enhance the role of such institutions in providing access and quality education to low-income and minority students;(7) these institutions play an important role in the American system of higher education, and there is a strong national interest in assisting them in solving their problems and in stabilizing their management and fiscal operations, and in becoming financially independent; and(8) there is a particular national interest in aiding those institutions of higher education that have historically served students who have been denied access to postsecondary education because of race or national origin and whose participation in the American system of higher education is in the Nation\u2019s interest so that equality of access and quality of postsecondary education opportunities may be enhanced for all students.(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this subchapter to assist such institutions in equalizing educational opportunity through a program of Federal assistance.(Pub.

Findings and purposesThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) the historically Black colleges and universities have contributed significantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity through postsecondary education for Black, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged Americans;(2) States and the Federal Government have discriminated in the allocation of land and financial resources to support Black public institutions under the Morrill Act of 1862 [7 U.S.C. 301(3) the current state of Black colleges and universities is partly attributable to the discriminatory action of the States and the Federal Government and this discriminatory action requires the remedy of enhancement of Black postsecondary institutions to ensure their continuation and participation in fulfilling the Federal mission of equality of educational opportunity; and(4) financial assistance to establish or stren", "gthen the physical plants, financial management, academic resources, and endowments of the historically Black colleges and universities are appropriate methods to enhance these institutions and facilitate a decrease in reliance on governmental financial support and to encourage reliance on endowments and private sources.(Pub.

White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through Historically Black Colleges and UniversitiesEx. Ord. No. 14041, Sept. 3, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to advance equity in economic and educational opportunities for all Americans, including Black Americans, strengthen the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to provide the highest-quality education, increase opportunities for these institutions to participate in and benefit from Federal programs, and ensure that HBCUs can continue to be engines of opportunity, it is hereby ordered as f", "ollows:SectionPolicyHBCUs play a vital role in providing educational opportunities, scholarly growth, and a sense of community for students. HBCU graduates are barrier-breaking public servants, scientists, artists, lawyers, engineers, educators, business owners, and leaders. For generations, HBCUs have been advancing intergenerational economic mobility for Black families and communities, developing vital academic research, and making our country more prosperous and equitable. HBCUs are proven means of advancement for people of all ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds, especially Black Americans. HBCUs produce nearly 20 percent of all Black college graduates and 25 percent of Black graduates who earn degrees in the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math.HBCUs\u2019 successes have come despite many systemic barriers to accessing resources and opportunities. For example, compared to other higher education institutions, on average HBCUs educate a greater percentage of lower-income, Pell-grant eligible students, while receiving less revenue from tuition and possessing much smaller endowments. Disparities in resources and opportunities for HBCUs and their students remain, and the COVID\u201319 pandemic has highlighted continuing and new challenges. These challenges include addressing the need for enhanced physical and digital infrastructure in HBCU communities and ensuring equitable funding for HBCUs as compared to other institutions of higher education. The Federal Government must promote a variety of modern solutions for HBCUs, recognizing that HBCUs are not a monolith, and that the opportunities and challenges relevant to HBCUs are as diverse as the institutions themselves and the communities they serve.It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity in partnership with HBCUs, and to ensure that these vital institutions of higher learning have the resources and support to continue to thrive for generations to come.Sec.White House Initiative on Ad", "vancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity through Historically Black Colleges and Universities(b) The Initiative, in coordination with senior officials across the Executive Office of the President, shall provide advice to the President on advancing equity, excellence, and opportunity at HBCUs and for the communities they principally serve by coordinating a Government-wide policymaking effort to eliminate barriers HBCUs face in providing the highest-quality education to a growing number of students.

FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) It is incumbent on the Federal Government to support the technological and economic competitiveness of the United States by improving and expanding the scientific and technological capacity of the United States. More and better prepared scientists, engineers, and technical experts are needed to improve and expand such capacity.(2) As the Nation\u2019s population becomes more diverse, it is important that the educational and training needs of all Americans are met. Underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields diminishes our Nation\u2019s competitiveness by impairing the quantity of well pr", "epared scientists, engineers, and technical experts in these fields.(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, minority institutions provide an important educational opportunity for minority students, particularly in science and engineering fields. Aid to minority institutions is a good way to address the underrepresentation of minorities in science and technological fields.(4) There is a strong Federal interest in improving science and engineering programs at minority institutions as such programs lag behind in program offerings and in student enrollment compared to such programs at other institutions of higher education.(Pub.
