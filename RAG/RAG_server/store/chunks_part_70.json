A Payment Recapture Audit is a process of identifying improper payments paid to contractors or other entities whereby highly skilled accounting specialists and fraud examiners use state-of-the-art tools and technology to examine payment records and uncover such problems as duplicate payments, payments for services not rendered, overpayments, and fictitious vendors. (A Payment Recapture Audit as used in this memorandum shall have the same meaning as the term \u201crecovery audit\u201d as defined in Appendix C to Office of Management and Budget Circular A-123.) One approach that has worked effectively is using professional and specialized auditors on a contingency basis, with their compensation tied to the identification of misspent funds.Therefore, I hereby direct executive departments and agencies to expand their use of Payment Recapture Audits, to the extent permitted by law and where cost-effective. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall develop guidance within 90 days of the date of this memorandum on actions executive departments and agencies must take to carry out the requirements of this memorandum. The guidance may require additional actions and strategies designed to improve the recapture of improper payments, including, as appropriate, agency-specific targets for increasing recoveries. The Director of the OMB shall further coordinate with the Council for Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency to identify an appropriate process for obtaining review by Inspectors General of the effectiveness of age", "ncy efforts under this memorandum. The agencies\u2019 expanded use of Payment Recapture Audits does not preclude Offices of Inspectors General from performing any activities to identify and prevent improper payments.Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to require the disclosure of classified information, law enforcement sensitive information, or other information that must be protected in the interests of national security.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama.\nEnhancing Payment Accuracy Through a \u201cDo Not Pay List\u201dMemorandum of President of the United States, June 18, 2010Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesMy Administration is committed to eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse in Federal programs, including reducing and recapturing erroneous payments\u2014a commitment I reinforced in Executive Order 13520 of November 20, 2009March 10, 2010Agencies maintain many databases containing information on a recipient\u2019s eligibility to receive Federal benefits payments or Federal awards, such as grants and contracts. By checking these databases before making payments or awards, agencies can identify ineligible recipients and prevent certain improper payments from being made in the first place.Therefore, I hereby direct agencies to review current pre-payment and pre-award procedures and ensure that a thorough review of available databases with relevant information on eligibility occurs before the release of any Federal funds, to the extent permitted by law. At a minimum, agencies shall, before payment and award, check the following existing databases (where applicable and permitted by law) to verify eligibility: the Social Security Administration\u2019s ", "Death Master File, the General Services Administration\u2019s Excluded Parties List System, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Debt Check Database, the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Credit Alert System or Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System, and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General\u2019s List of Excluded Individuals/Entities. This network of databases, and additional databases so designated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in consultation with agencies, shall be collectively known as the \u201cDo Not Pay List.\u201d This memorandum requires agencies to review these databases with the recognition that there may be circumstances when the law nevertheless requires a payment or award to be made to a recipient listed in them. My Administration began coordination of the databases discussed in this memorandum in April 2010 by launching the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), which integrates various sources of information on the eligibility of Government contractors for award. No later than 120 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the OMB shall provide to the President a plan for completing integration for the remaining databases, to the extent permitted by law, so that agencies can access them through a single entry point.Each agency shall, within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, submit to the OMB a plan that includes information on its current pre-payment and pre-award procedures and a list of databases that the agency checks pursuant to those procedures. Within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the OMB shall issue guidance, to be developed in consultation with affected agencies and taking into account current agency pre-payment and pre-award practices, on actions agencies must take to carry out this memorandum\u2019s requirements. This guidance shall clarify that the head of each agency is responsible for ensuring an efficient and accurate process for determining whether th", "e information provided on the \u201cDo Not Pay List\u201d is sufficient to stop a payment, consistent with applicable laws and regulations, and, if so, whether a payment should be stopped under the circumstances. In addition, this guidance shall identify best practices and databases that agencies should utilize to conduct pre-payment checks to ensure that only eligible recipients receive Government benefits or payments.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f3352.

SHORT TITLE[.]\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996.\u2019\u201cSEC. 802. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) Much effor", "t has been devoted to strengthening Federal internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards have not been uniformly implemented in financial management systems for agencies.\u201c(2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal practices have failed to\u2014\u201c(A) identify costs fully;\u201c(B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; and\u201c(C) accurately report the financial condition of the Federal Government.\u201c(3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately report financial results of the Federal Government or the full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of these practices undermines the Government\u2019s ability to provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in achieving a balanced budget.\u201c(4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government undermine the confidence of the American people in the government and reduce the federal Government\u2019s ability to address vital public needs adequately.\u201c(5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the Federal Government, agencies must incorporate accounting standards and reporting objectives established for the Federal Government into their financial management systems so that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout the Federal Government.\u201c(6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018FASAB\u2019) has made substantial progress toward developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are incorporated", " into Federal financial management systems, agencies will be able to provide cost and financial information that will assist the Congress and financial managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal programs and activities, and will therefore provide important information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved decision making by financial managers and the Congress.\u201c(7) The development of financial management systems with the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, over the long term, improve Federal financial management.\u201c(b) Purpose\u201c(1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards throughout the Federal Government;\u201c(2) require Federal financial management systems to support full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that programs and activities can be considered based on their full costs and merits;\u201c(3) increase the accountability and credibility of federal [sic] financial management;\u201c(4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of Federal Government financial management;\u201c(5) establish financial management systems to support controlling the cost of Federal Government;\u201c(6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101\u2013576section 501 of this titlePublic Law 103\u201362107 Stat. 285section 1101 of this titlePublic Law 103\u2013356108 Stat. 3410section 3301 of this title\u201c(7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports that compare spending of resources to results of activities.\u201cSEC. 803.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards have not been uniformly implemented in financial management systems for agencies.\u201c(2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal practices have failed to\u2014\u201c(A) identify costs fully;\u201c(B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; and\u201c(C) accurately report the financial condition of the Federal Government.\u201c(3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately report financial results of the Federal Government or the full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of these practices undermines the Government\u2019s ability to provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in achieving a balanced budget.\u201c(4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government undermine the confidence of the American people in the government and reduce the federal Government\u2019s ability to address vital public needs adequately.\u201c(5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the Federal Government, agencies must ", "incorporate accounting standards and reporting objectives established for the Federal Government into their financial management systems so that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported throughout the Federal Government.\u201c(6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to as the \u2018FASAB\u2019) has made substantial progress toward developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are incorporated into Federal financial management systems, agencies will be able to provide cost and financial information that will assist the Congress and financial managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal programs and activities, and will therefore provide important information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved decision making by financial managers and the Congress.\u201c(7) The development of financial management systems with the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, over the long term, improve Federal financial management.\u201c(b) Purpose\u201c(1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards throughout the Federal Government;\u201c(2) require Federal financial management systems to support full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that programs and activities can be considered based on their full costs and merits;\u201c(3) increase the accountability and credibility of federal [sic] financial management;\u201c(4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of Federal Government financial management;\u201c(5) establish financial management systems to ", "support controlling the cost of Federal Government;\u201c(6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Public Law 101\u2013576section 501 of this titlePublic Law 103\u201362107 Stat. 285section 1101 of this titlePublic Law 103\u2013356108 Stat. 3410section 3301 of this title\u201c(7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports that compare spending of resources to results of activities. \u201cSEC. 803.

As far as can be determined, the phrase \u201cmoney of account\u201d has not been interpreted by any court or Government agency. The phrase was used by Alexander Hamilton in his \u201cReport on the Establishment of the Mint\u201d (1791). In that Report, Hamilton propounded 6 questions, including:\u20011st. What ought to be the nature of the money unit of the United States?Thereafter, Hamilton uses the phrases \u201cmoney unit of the United States\u201d and \u201cmoney of account\u201d interchangeably and in the sense that the phrases are used to denote the monetary system for keeping financial accounts. In short, the phrases simply indicate that financial accounts are to be based on a decimal money system:\u2026, and it is certain that nothing can be more simple and convenient than the decimal subdivisions. There is every reason to expect that the method will speedily grow into general use, when it shall be seconded by corresponding coins. On this plan the unit in the money of account will continue to be, as established by that resolution [of August 8, 1786Thus, the phrase \u201cmoney of account\u201d did not mean, by itself, that dollars or fractions of dollars must be equal to something having intrinsic or \u201csubstantive\u201d value. This concept is supported by earlier writings of Thomas Jefferson in his \u201cNotes on the Establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States\u201d (1784), and the 1782 report to the President of the Continental Congress on the coinage of the United States by the Superintendent of Finances, Robert Morris, which was apparently prepared by the Assistant Superintendent, Gouverneur Morris.

The Morgan silver dollar was minted at Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, Carson City, and New Orleans.\u201c(3) The Peace silver dollar was designed by Anthony de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on the obverse and a bald eagle clutching the olive branch (a symbol of peace) on the reverse.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation\u2019s greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation\u2019s history.\u201c(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809\u201c(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.\u201c(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.\u201c(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin\u2019s bullet on April 15, 1865\u201c(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln\u2019s life is a model for accomplishing the \u2018American dream\u2019 through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\u201c(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of th", "e birth of Abraham Lincoln.\u201c(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.\u201c(9) The so-called \u2018Lincoln cent\u2019 was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln\u2019s birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation\u2019s coinage.\u201c(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.\u201c(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the \u2018Lincoln cent\u2019, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\u201c(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln\u2019s birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln\u2019s life.\u201cSEC. 302.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\u201cIt is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in 2009.\u201dDesigns on the 5-Cent CoinPub.

FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress finds that [sic] following:\u201c(1) In December 1921, the Peace silver dollar was approved by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, replacing the Morgan silver dollar and commemorating the declaration of peace between the United States and the Imperial German government.\u201c(2) The Peace silver dollar was minted in Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco. The Morgan silver dollar was minted at Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, Carson City, and New Orleans.\u201c(3) The Peace silver dollar was designed by Anthony de Francisci with the Goddess of Liberty on the obverse and a bald eagle clutching the olive branch (a symbol of peace) on the reverse. The Peace silver dollars were minted between 1921 to 1935.\u201c(4) The Morgan silver dollar was designed by George T. Morgan and was minted from 1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. The obverse depicts a profile portrait of Lady Liberty and on the reverse, a heraldic eagle.\u201c(5) The conversion from the Morgan silver dollar to the Peace silver dollar design in 1921 reflected a pivotal moment in American history. The Morgan silver dollar represents the country\u2019s westward expansion and industrial development in the late 19th century. The Peace silver dollar symbolizes the country\u2019s coming of age as an international power while recognizing the sacrifices", " made by her citizens in World War I and celebrating the victory and peace that ensued.\u201c(6) These iconic silver dollars with vastly different representations of Lady Liberty and the American Eagle, reflect a changing of the guard in 1921 in the United States and therefore on the 100th anniversary must begin to be minted again to commemorate this significant evolution of American freedom. \u201cSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the Nation\u2019s greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation\u2019s history.\u201c(2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County (present-day LaRue County), Kentucky, on February 12, 1809\u201c(3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States.\u201c(4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice toward none, and with charity for all.\u201c(5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin\u2019s bullet on April 15, 1865\u201c(6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln\u2019s life is a model for accomplishing the \u2018American dream\u2019 through honesty, integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.\u201c(7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln.\u201c(8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in Washington, D.C.\u201c(9) The so-called \u2018Lincoln cent\u2019 was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln\u2019s birth, making the obverse design the most enduring on the nation\u2019s coinage.\u201c(10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the talent of Victor David Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.\u201c(11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the \u2018Lincoln cent\u2019, there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.\u201c(12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President Lincoln\u2019s birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, it is ent", "irely fitting to issue a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln\u2019s life. \u201cSEC. 302. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.\u201c(a) In GeneralDuring the year 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the following design specifications:\u201c(1) ObverseThe obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President Abraham Lincoln.\u201c(2) ReverseThe reverse of the coins shall bear 4 different designs each representing a different aspect of the life of Abraham Lincoln, such as\u2014\u201c(A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;\u201c(B) his formative years in Indiana;\u201c(C) his professional life in Illinois; and\u201c(D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.\u201c(b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in\u201c(1) OrderThe 1-cent coins to which this section applies shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar quarter of 2009.\u201c(2) NumberThe Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.\u201c(c) Design SelectionThe designs for the coins specified in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary\u2014\u201c(1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and\u201c(2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee. \u201cSEC. 303.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\u201cIt is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor Da", "vid Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic departure from previous American coinage that should be reproduced, using the original form and relief of the likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in 2009.\u201d \u201cSEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS RESOLUTION.\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress hereby makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Congress has authorized 18 commemorative coin programs in the 9 years since 1984.\u201c(2) There are more meritorious causes, events, and people worthy of commemoration than can be honored with commemorative coinage.\u201c(3) Commemorative coin legislation has increased at a pace beyond that which the numismatic community can reasonably be expected to absorb.\u201c(4) It is in the interests of all Members of Congress that a policy be established to control the flow of commemorative coin legislation.\u201c(b) DeclarationIt is the sense of the Congress that the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs [now Committee on Financial Services] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate should not report or otherwise clear for consideration by the House of Representatives or the Senate legislation providing for more than 2 commemorative coin programs for any year, unless the committee determines, on the basis of a recommendation by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee, that extraordinary merit exists for an additional commemorative coin program. \u201cSEC. 302.

IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COOPERATION TO FIGHT TERRORIST FINANCING.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The global war on terrorism and cutting off terrorist financing is a policy priority for the United States and its partners, working bilaterally and multilaterally through the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council and its committees, such as the 1267 and 1373 Committees, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and various international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the regional multilateral development banks, and other multilateral fora.\u201c(2) The international financial community has become engaged in the global fight against terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force has focused on the new threat posed by terrorist financing to the international financial system, resulting in the establishment of the FATF\u2019s Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as the international standard on combating terrorist financing. The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.\u201c(3) FATF\u2019s Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financin", "g are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.\u201c(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction\u2019s financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.\u201c(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficiencies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.\u201c(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.\u201c(7) In fulfil", "ling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs\u2019 work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.\u201c(b) Sense of Congress Regarding Success in Multilateral OrganizationsIt is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF 40 + 8 Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards.\u201cSEC. 7702.

and\u201c(10) the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory Practices and the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, of both of which the United States is a member, have each adopted international anti-money laundering principles and recommendations.\u201c(b) PurposesThe purposes ", "of this title [see Short Title of 2001 Amendment note set out under section 5301 of this title\u201c(1) to increase the strength of United States measures to prevent, detect, and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism;\u201c(2) to ensure that\u2014\u201c(A) banking transactions and financial relationships and the conduct of such transactions and relationships, do not contravene the purposes of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, section 21 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [12 U.S.C. 1829bPublic Law 91\u201350884 Stat. 111612 U.S.C. 1951\u201c(B) the purposes of such provisions of law continue to be fulfilled, and such provisions of law are effectively and efficiently administered;\u201c(3) to strengthen the provisions put into place by the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 (18 U.S.C. 981section 981 of Title 18\u201c(4) to provide a clear national mandate for subjecting to special scrutiny those foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that pose particular, identifiable opportunities for criminal abuse;\u201c(5) to provide the Secretary of the Treasury (in this title referred to as the \u2018Secretary\u2019) with broad discretion, subject to the safeguards provided by the Administrative Procedure Act under title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C. 551\u201c(6) to ensure that the employment of such measures by the Secretary permits appropriate opportunity for comment by affected financial institutions;\u201c(7) to provide guidance to domestic financial institutions on particular foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions operating outside of the United States, and classes of international transactions or types of accounts that are of primary money laundering concern to the United States Government;\u201c(8) to ensure that the forfeiture of any assets in connection with the anti-terrorist efforts of the United States permits for adequate challenge consistent with providing due process rights;\u201c(9) to clarify the term", "s of the safe harbor from civil liability for filing suspicious activity reports;\u201c(10) to strengthen the authority of the Secretary to issue and administer geographic targeting orders, and to clarify that violations of such orders or any other requirement imposed under the authority contained in chapter 2 of title I of Public Law 91\u201350812 U.S.C. 1951\u201c(11) to ensure that all appropriate elements of the financial services industry are subject to appropriate requirements to report potential money laundering transactions to proper authorities, and that jurisdictional disputes do not hinder examination of compliance by financial institutions with relevant reporting requirements;\u201c(12) to strengthen the ability of financial institutions to maintain the integrity of their employee population;

IMPROVING INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND COOPERATION TO FIGHT TERRORIST FINANCING.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The global war on terrorism and cutting off terrorist financing is a policy priority for the United States and its partners, working bilaterally and multilaterally through the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council and its committees, such as the 1267 and 1373 Committees, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), and various international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the regional multilateral development banks, and other multilateral fora.\u201c(2) The international financial community has become engaged in the global fight against terrorist financing. The Financial Action Task Force has focused on the new threat posed by terrorist financing to the international financial system, resulting in the e", "stablishment of the FATF\u2019s Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing as the international standard on combating terrorist financing. The Group of Seven and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers are developing action plans to curb the financing of terror. In addition, other economic and regional fora, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum, and the Western Hemisphere Financial Ministers, have been used to marshal political will and actions in support of combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.\u201c(3) FATF\u2019s Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing are the recognized global standards for fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. The FATF has engaged in an assessment process for jurisdictions based on their compliance with these standards.\u201c(4) In March 2004, the IMF and IBRD Boards agreed to make permanent a pilot program of collaboration with the FATF to assess global compliance with the FATF Forty Recommendations on Money Laundering and the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. As a result, anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) assessments are now a regular part of their Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Offshore Financial Center assessments, which provide for a comprehensive analysis of the strength of a jurisdiction\u2019s financial system. These reviews assess potential systemic vulnerabilities, consider sectoral development needs and priorities, and review the state of implementation of and compliance with key financial codes and regulatory standards, among them the AML and CFT standards.\u201c(5) To date, 70 FSAPs have been conducted, with over 24 of those incorporating AML and CFT assessments. The international financial institutions (IFIs), the FATF, and the FATF-style regional bodies together are expected to assess AML and CFT regimes in up to 40 countries or jurisdictions per year. This will help countries and jurisdictions identify deficie", "ncies in their AML and CFT regimes and help focus technical assistance efforts.\u201c(6) Technical assistance programs from the United States and other nations, coordinated with the Department of State and other departments and agencies, are playing an important role in helping countries and jurisdictions address shortcomings in their AML and CFT regimes and bringing their regimes into conformity with international standards. Training is coordinated within the United States Government, which leverages multilateral organizations and bodies and international financial institutions to internationalize the conveyance of technical assistance.\u201c(7) In fulfilling its duties in advancing incorporation of AML and CFT standards into the IFIs as part of the IFIs\u2019 work on protecting the integrity of the international monetary system, the Department of the Treasury, under the guidance of the Secretary of the Treasury, has effectively brought together all of the key United States Government agencies. In particular, United States Government agencies continue to work together to foster broad support for this important undertaking in various multilateral fora, and United States Government agencies recognize the need for close coordination and communication within our own Government.\u201c(b) Sense of Congress Regarding Success in Multilateral OrganizationsIt is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of the Treasury should continue to promote the dissemination of international AML and CFT standards, and to press for full implementation of the FATF 40 + 8 Recommendations by all countries in order to curb financial risks and hinder terrorist financing around the globe. The efforts of the Secretary in this regard should include, where necessary or appropriate, multilateral action against countries whose counter-money laundering regimes and efforts against the financing of terrorism fall below recognized international standards. \u201cSEC. 7702.

L. 107\u201356, title III, \u00a7\u202f371(a)Oct. 26, 2001115 Stat. 336\n\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) Effective enforcement of the currency reporting requirements of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code, and the regulations prescribed under such subchapter, has forced drug dealers and other criminals engaged in cash-based businesses to avoid using traditional financial institutions.\u201c(2) In their effort to avoid using traditional financial institutions, drug dealers and other criminals are forced to move large quantities of currency in bulk form to and through the airports, border crossings, and other ports of entry where the currency can be smuggled out of the United States and placed in a foreign financial institution or sold on the black market.\u201c(3) The transportation and smuggling of cash in bulk form may now be the most common form of money laundering, and the movement of large sums of cash is one of the most reliable warning signs of drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering, racketeering, tax evasion and similar crimes.\u201c(4) The intentional transportation into or out of the United States of large amounts of currency or monetary instruments, in a manner designed to circumvent the mandatory reporting provisions of subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31, United States Code,, [sic] is the equivalent of, and creates the same harm as, the smuggling of goods.\u201c(5) The arrest and prosecution of bulk cash s", "mugglers are important parts of law enforcement\u2019s effort to stop the laundering of criminal proceeds, but the couriers who attempt to smuggle the cash out of the United States are typically low-level employees of large criminal organizations, and thus are easily replaced. Accordingly, only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.\u201c(6) The current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds. In particular, in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a reporting offense, the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency. In contrast, if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense, the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.\u201c(b) PurposesThe purposes of this section [enacting this section] are\u2014\u201c(1) to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense;\u201c(2) to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense; and\u201c(3) to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.\u201d \u00a7\u202f5333.

However, a payment may not be more than the amount of real property taxes levied on the property during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest is acquired. A decision on fair market value under this section may not include an increase in the value of an interest because the land is rezoned when the rezoning causes the increase after the date of enactment of a law authorizing the acquisition of an interest under subsection (a) of this section.(d) The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments may be made to units of general local government when subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not carry out the purpose of subsections (a) and (b).(Pub.
