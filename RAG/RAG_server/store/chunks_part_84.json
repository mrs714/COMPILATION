Such cancellation or limitation could result in disincentives for appropriate counseling, testing, treatment, and services.\u201c(7) For the reasons specified in paragraphs (1) through (6)\u2014\u201c(A) routine HIV counseling and voluntary testing of pregnant women should become the standard of care; and\u201c(B) the relevant medical organizations as well as public health officials should issue guidelines making such counseling and testing the standard of care.\u201d \u00a7\u202f300ff\u201334.

These actions are especially important in light of the prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic as well as the suicide and substance use-related fatalities that have reversed increases in longevity in certain populations. One important response has been the expansion and implementation of mental health and substance use disorder parity protections to ensure that coverage for these benefits is comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care. The Affordable Care Act builds on the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act to expand mental health and substance use disorder benefits and Federal parity protections for more than 60 million Americans. To realize the promise of coverage expansion and parity protections in helping individuals with mental health and substance use disorders, executive departments and agencies need to work together to ensure that Americans are benefiting from the Federal parity protections the law intends. To that end, I hereby direct the following:SectionMental Health and Substance Use Disorder Parity Task Force(a) Membership of the Task Force(i) the Depar", "tment of the Treasury;(ii) the Department of Defense;(iii) the Department of Justice;(iv) the Department of Labor;(v) the Department of Health and Human Services;(vi) the Department of Veterans Affairs;(vii) the Office of Personnel Management;(viii) the Office of National Drug Control Policy; and(ix) such other agencies or offices as the President may designate.At the request of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this section, as appropriate.(b) Administration of the Task ForceSecMission and Functions of the Task Force(a) identify and promote best practices for compliance and implementation;(b) identify and address gaps in guidance, particularly with regard to substance use disorder parity; and(c) implement actions during its tenure and at its conclusion to advance parity in mental health and substance use disorder treatment.SecOutreachSecTransparency and ReportsOctober 31, 2016SecGeneral Provisions(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(e) The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f300gg\u201327.

the amount established for purposes of this clause by subparagraph (B),(ii) 32 percent of the individual\u2019s average indexed monthly earnings to the extent that such earnings exceed the amount established for purposes of clause (i) but do not exceed the amount established for purposes of this clause by subparagraph (B), and(iii) 15 percent of the individual\u2019s average indexed monthly earnings to the extent that such earnings exceed the amount established for purposes of clause (ii),rounded, if not a multiple of $0.10, to the next lower multiple of $0.10, and thereafter increased as provided in subsection (i).(B)(i) For individuals who initially become eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who die (before becoming eligible for such benefits), in the calendar year 1979, the amount established for purposes of clause (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall be $180 and $1,085, respectively.(ii) For individuals who initially become eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who die (before becoming eligible for such benefits), in any calendar year after 1979, each of the amounts so established shall equal the product of the corresponding amount established with respect to the calendar year 1979 under clause (i) of this subparagraph and the quotient obtained by dividing\u2014(I) the national average wage index (as defined in section 409(k)(1) of this title(II) the national average wage index (as so defined) for 1977.(iii) Each amount established under clause (ii) for any calendar year shall be rounded to the nearest

insurance benefit until the month in which he became so entitled or reentitled or died, or(ii) the amount computed under paragraph (1)(C).(C) In the case of an individual who was entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any month, and with respect to whom a primary insurance amount is required to be computed at any time after the close of the period of the individual\u2019s disability (whether because of such individual\u2019s subsequent entitlement to old-age insurance benefits or to a disability insurance benefit based upon a subsequent period of disability, or because of such individual\u2019s death), the primary insurance amount so computed may in no case be less than the primary insurance amount with respect to which such former disability insurance benefit was most recently determined.(3)(A) Paragraph (1) applies only to an individual who was not eligible for an old-age insurance benefit prior to January 1979 and who in that or any succeeding month\u2014(i)

benefits prior to 1984, or(ii) as provided by subsection (d), in the case of an individual to whom such section applies.In determining whether an individual\u2019s primary insurance amount would be greater if computed or recomputed as provided in subparagraph (B), (I) the table of benefits in effect in December 1978, as modified by paragraph (6), shall be applied without regard to any increases in that table which may become effective (in accordance with subsection (i)(4)) for years after 1978 (subject to clause (iii) of subsection (i)(2)(A)) and (II) such individual\u2019s average monthly

individual to whom paragraph (1) does not apply (other than an individual described in paragraph (4)(B)), this section as in effect in December 1978 shall remain in effect, except that, effective for January 1979, the dollar amount specified in paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be increased to $11.50.(B)(i) Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), and notwithstanding any other prov", "ision of law, the primary insurance amount of any individual described in subparagraph (C) shall be, in lieu of the primary insurance amount as computed pursuant to any of the provisions referred to in

effect.(ii) The computation of a primary insurance amount under this subparagraph shall be subject to section 104(j)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (relating to the number of elapsed
