L. 108\u2013105, \u00a7\u202f2Nov. 5, 2003117 Stat. 1201\n\u201cThe Congress finds and declares the following:\u201c(1) A moral, medical, and ethical consensus exists that the practice of performing a partial-birth abortion\u2014an abortion in which a physician deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living, unborn child\u2019s body until either the entire baby\u2019s head is outside the body of the mother, or any part of the baby\u2019s trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother and only the head remains inside the womb, for the purpose of performing an overt act (usually the puncturing of the back of the child\u2019s skull and removing the baby\u2019s brains) that the person knows will kill the partially delivered infant, performs this act, and then completes delivery of the dead infant\u2014is a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary and should be prohibited.\u201c(2) Rather than being an abortion procedure that is embraced", " by the medical community, particularly among physicians who routinely perform other abortion procedures, partial-birth abortion remains a disfavored procedure that is not only unnecessary to preserve the health of the mother, but in fact poses serious risks to the long-term health of women and in some circumstances, their lives. As a result, at least 27 States banned the procedure as did the United States Congress which voted to ban the procedure during the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses.\u201c(3) In Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 932 (2000), the United States Supreme Court opined \u2018that significant medical authority supports the proposition that in some circumstances, [partial birth abortion] would be the safest procedure\u2019 for pregnant women who wish to undergo an abortion. Thus, the Court struck down the State of Nebraska\u2019s ban on partial-birth abortion procedures, concluding that it placed an \u2018undue burden\u2019 on women seeking abortions because it failed to include an exception for partial-birth abortions deemed necessary to preserve the \u2018health\u2019 of the mother.\u201c(4) In reaching this conclusion, the Court deferred to the Federal district court\u2019s factual findings that the partial-birth abortion procedure was statistically and medically as safe as, and in many circumstances safer than, alternative abortion procedures.\u201c(5) However, substantial evidence presented at the Stenberg trial and overwhelming evidence presented and compiled at extensive congressional hearings, much of which was compiled after the district court hearing in Stenberg, and thus not included in the Stenberg trial record, demonstrates that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses significant health risks to a woman upon whom the procedure is performed and is outside the standard of medical care.\u201c(6) Despite the dearth of evidence in the Stenberg trial court record supporting the district court\u2019s findings, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court refused to set asid", "e the district court\u2019s factual findings because, under the applicable standard of appellate review, they were not \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous \u2018when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed\u2019. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985). Under this standard, \u2018if the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently\u2019. Id. at 574.\u201c(7) Thus, in Stenberg, the United States Supreme Court was required to accept the very questionable findings issued by the district court judge\u2014the effect of which was to render null and void the reasoned factual findings and policy determinations of the United States Congress and at least 27 State legislatures.\u201c(8) However, under well-settled Supreme Court jurisprudence, the United States Congress is not bound to accept the same factual findings that the Supreme Court was bound to accept in Stenberg under the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard. Rather, the United States Congress is entitled to reach its own factual findings\u2014findings that the Supreme Court accords great deference\u2014and to enact legislation based upon these findings so long as it seeks to pursue a legitimate interest that is within the scope of the Constitution, and draws reasonable inferences based upon substantial evidence.\u201c(9) In Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641 (1966), the Supreme Court articulated its highly deferential review of congressional factual findings when it addressed the constitutionality of section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 [52 U.S.C. 10303(e)\u201c(10) Katzenbach\u2019s highly deferential review of Congress\u2019 factual conclusions was relied upon by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia when it upheld t", "he \u2018bail-out\u2019 provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973c52 U.S.C. 10304\u201c(11) The Court continued its practice of deferring to congressional factual findings in reviewing the constitutionality of the must-carry provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 [Pub. L. 102\u2013385\u201c(12) Three years later in Turner II, the Court upheld the \u2018must-carry\u2019 provisions based upon Congress\u2019 findings, stating the Court\u2019s \u2018sole obligation is \u201cto assure that, in formulating its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.\u201d\u202f\u2019 520 U.S. at 195. Citing its ruling in Turner I, the Court reiterated that \u2018[w]e owe Congress\u2019 findings deference in part because the institution \u201cis far better equipped than the judiciary to \u2018amass and evaluate the vast amounts of data\u2019 bearing upon\u201d legislative questions,\u2019 id. at 195, and added that it \u2018owe[d] Congress\u2019 findings an additional measure of deference out of respect for its authority to exercise the legislative power.\u2019. Id. at 196.\u201c(13) There exists substantial record evidence upon which Congress has reached its conclusion that a ban on partial-birth abortion is not required to contain a \u2018health\u2019 exception, because the facts indicate that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses serious risks to a woman\u2019s health, and lies outside the standard of medical care. Congress was informed by extensive hearings held during the 104th, 105th, 107th, and 108th Congresses and passed a ban on partial-birth abortion in the 104th, 105th, and 106th Congresses. These findings reflect the very informed judgment of the Congress that a partial-birth abortion is never necessary to preserve the health of a woman, poses serious risks to a woman\u2019s health, and lies outside the standard of medical care, and should, therefore, be banned.\u201c(14) Pursuant to the testimony received during extensive legislative hearings during the 104th, 105th, 107th, and 108th Congresses, Congress finds and declare", "s that:\u201c(A) Partial-birth abortion poses serious risks to the health of a woman undergoing the procedure. Those risks include, among other things: An increase in a woman\u2019s risk of suffering from cervical incompetence, a result of cervical dilation making it difficult or impossible for a woman to successfully carry a subsequent pregnancy to term; an increased risk of uterine rupture, abruption, amniotic fluid embolus, and trauma to the uterus as a result of converting the child to a footling breech position, a procedure which, according to a leading obstetrics textbook, \u2018there are very few, if any, indications for *\u2000*\u2000* other than for delivery of a second twin\u2019; and a risk of lacerations and secondary hemorrhaging due to the doctor blindly forcing a sharp instrument into the base of the unborn child\u2019s skull while he or she is lodged in the birth canal, an act which could result in severe bleeding, brings with it the threat of shock, and could ultimately result in maternal death.\u201c(B) There is no credible medical evidence that partial-birth abortions are safe or are safer than other abortion procedures. No controlled studies of partial-birth abortions have been conducted nor have any comparative studies been conducted to demonstrate its safety and efficacy compared to other abortion methods. Furthermore, there have been no articles published in peer-reviewed journals that establish that partial-birth abortions are superior in any way to established abortion procedures. Indeed, unlike other more commonly used abortion procedures, there are currently no medical schools that provide instruction on abortions that include the instruction in partial-birth abortions in their curriculum.\u201c(C) A prominent medical association has concluded that partial-birth abortion is \u2018not an accepted medical practice\u2019, that it has \u2018never been subject to even a minimal amount of the normal medical practice development,\u2019 that \u2018the relative advantages and disadvantages of the procedure in specific circumstances remain unknown,\u2019 and that \u2018there", " is no consensus among obstetricians about its use\u2019. The association has further noted that partial-birth abortion is broadly disfavored by both medical experts and the public, is \u2018ethically wrong,\u2019 and \u2018is never the only appropriate procedure\u2019.\u201c(D) Neither the plaintiff in Stenberg v. Carhart, nor the experts who testified on his behalf, have identified a single circumstance during which a partial-birth abortion was necessary to preserve the health of a woman.\u201c(E) The physician credited with developing the partial-birth abortion procedure has testified that he has never encountered a situation where a partial-birth abortion was medically necessary to achieve the desired outcome and, thus, is never medically necessary to preserve the health of a woman.\u201c(F) A ban on the partial-birth abortion procedure will therefore advance the health interests of pregnant women seeking to terminate a pregnancy.\u201c(G) In light of this overwhelming evidence, Congress and the States have a compelling interest in prohibiting partial-birth abortions. In addition to promoting maternal health, such a prohibition will draw a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide, that preserves the integrity of the medical profession, and promotes respect for human life.\u201c(H) Based upon Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992), a governmental interest in protecting the life of a child during the delivery process arises by virtue of the fact that during a partial-birth abortion, labor is induced and the birth process has begun. This distinction was recognized in Roe when the Court noted, without comment, that the Texas parturition statute, which prohibited one from killing a child \u2018in a state of being born and before actual birth,\u2019 was not under attack. This interest becomes compelling as the child emerges from the maternal body. A child that is completely born is a full, legal person entitled to constitutional protections afforded a \u2018person\u2019 under the United States Constitution. Partial", "-birth abortions involve the killing of a child that is in the process, in fact mere inches away from, becoming a \u2018person\u2019. Thus, the government has a heightened interest in protecting the life of the partially-born child.\u201c(I) This, too, has not gone unnoticed in the medical community, where a prominent medical association has recognized that partial-birth abortions are \u2018ethically different from other destructive abortion techniques because the fetus, normally twenty weeks or longer in gestation, is killed outside of the womb\u2019. According to this medical association, the \u2018\u202f\u201cpartial birth\u201d gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body\u2019.\u201c(J) Partial-birth abortion also confuses the medical, legal, and ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life, as the physician acts directly against the physical life of a child, whom he or she had just delivered, all but the head, out of the womb, in order to end that life. Partial-birth abortion thus appropriates the terminology and techniques used by obstetricians in the delivery of living children\u2014obstetricians who preserve and protect the life of the mother and the child\u2014and instead uses those techniques to end the life of the partially-born child.\u201c(K) Thus, by aborting a child in the manner that purposefully seeks to kill the child after he or she has begun the process of birth, partial-birth abortion undermines the public\u2019s perception of the appropriate role of a physician during the delivery process, and perverts a process during which life is brought into the world, in order to destroy a partially-born child.\u201c(L) The gruesome and inhumane nature of the partial-birth abortion procedure and its disturbing similarity to the killing of a newborn infant promotes a complete disregard for infant human life that can only be countered by a prohibition of the procedure.\u201c(M) The vast majority of babies killed during partial-birth abortions are alive until the end of the procedure. It is a medical fact, ho", "wever, that unborn infants at this stage can feel pain when subjected to painful stimuli and that their perception of this pain is even more intense than that of newborn infants and older children when subjected to the same stimuli. Thus, during a partial-birth abortion procedure, the child will fully experience the pain associated with piercing his or her skull and sucking out his or her brain.\u201c(N) Implicitly approving such a brutal and inhumane procedure by choosing not to prohibit it will further coarsen society to the humanity of not only newborns, but all vulnerable and innocent human life, making it increasingly difficult to protect such life. Thus, Congress has a compelling interest in acting\u2014indeed it must act\u2014to prohibit this inhumane procedure.\u201c(O) For these reasons, Congress finds that partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to preserve the health of the mother; is in fact unrecognized as a valid abortion procedure by the mainstream medical community; poses additional health risks to the mother; blurs the line between abortion and infanticide in the killing of a partially-born child just inches from birth; and confuses the role of the physician in childbirth and should, therefore, be banned.\u201d \u00a7\u202f1541.

L. 110\u2013358, title I, \u00a7\u202f102Oct. 8, 2008122 Stat. 4001\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Child pornography is estimated to be a multibillion dollar industry of global proportions, facilitated by t", "he growth of the Internet.\u201c(2) Data has shown that 83 percent of child pornography possessors had images of children younger than 12 years old, 39 percent had images of children younger than 6 years old, and 19 percent had images of children younger than 3 years old.\u201c(3) Child pornography is a permanent record of a child\u2019s abuse and the distribution of child pornography images revictimizes the child each time the image is viewed.\u201c(4) Child pornography is readily available through virtually every Internet technology, including Web sites, email, instant messaging, Internet Relay Chat, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and peer-to-peer.\u201c(5) The technological ease, lack of expense, and anonymity in obtaining and distributing child pornography over the Internet has resulted in an explosion in the multijurisdictional distribution of child pornography.\u201c(6) The Internet is well recognized as a method of distributing goods and services across State lines.\u201c(7) The transmission of child pornography using the Internet constitutes transportation in interstate commerce.\u201dPub. L. 109\u2013248, title V, \u00a7\u202f501July 27, 2006120 Stat. 623\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The effect of the intrastate production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography on the interstate market in child pornography:\u201c(A) The illegal production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising and possession of child pornography, as defined in section 2256(8) of title 18\u201c(B) A substantial interstate market in child pornography exists, including not only a multimillion dollar industry, but also a nationwide network of individuals openly advertising their desire to exploit children and to traffic in child pornography. Many of these individuals distribute child pornography with the expectation of receiving other child pornography in return.\u201c(C) The interstate market in child pornography is carried on to a substantial extent through the mails and other instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, suc", "h as the Internet. The advent of the Internet has greatly increased the ease of transporting, distributing, receiving, and advertising child pornography in interstate commerce. The advent of digital cameras and digital video cameras, as well as videotape cameras, has greatly increased the ease of producing child pornography. The advent of inexpensive computer equipment with the capacity to store large numbers of digital images of child pornography has greatly increased the ease of possessing child pornography. Taken together, these technological advances have had the unfortunate result of greatly increasing the interstate market in child pornography.\u201c(D) Intrastate incidents of production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, have a substantial and direct effect upon interstate commerce because:\u201c(i) Some persons engaged in the production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography conduct such activities entirely within the boundaries of one state. These persons are unlikely to be content with the amount of child pornography they produce, transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess. These persons are therefore likely to enter the interstate market in child pornography in search of additional child pornography, thereby stimulating demand in the interstate market in child pornography.\u201c(ii) When the persons described in subparagraph (D)(i) enter the interstate market in search of additional child pornography, they are likely to distribute the child pornography they already produce, transport, distribute, receive, advertise, or possess to persons who will distribute additional child pornography to them, thereby stimulating supply in the interstate market in child pornography.\u201c(iii) Much of the child pornography that supplies the interstate market in child pornography is produced entirely within the boundaries of one state, is", " not traceable, and enters the interstate market surreptitiously. This child pornography supports demand in the interstate market in child pornography and is essential to its existence.\u201c(E) Prohibiting the intrastate production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of custody of children for the production of child pornography, will cause some persons engaged in such intrastate activities to cease all such activities, thereby reducing both supply and demand in the interstate market for child pornography.\u201c(F) Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the production, transportation, distribution, receipt, advertising, and possession of child pornography, as well as the intrastate transfer of children for the production of child pornography, is essential to the effective control of the interstate market in child pornography.\u201c(2) The importance of protecting children from repeat exploitation in child pornography:\u201c(A) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions today involve images contained on computer hard drives, computer disks, and related media.\u201c(B) Child pornography is not entitled to protection under the First Amendment and thus may be prohibited.\u201c(C) The government has a compelling State interest in protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain.\u201c(D) Every instance of viewing images of child pornography represents a renewed violation of the privacy of the victims and a repetition of their abuse.\u201c(E) Child pornography constitutes prima facie contraband, and as such should not be distributed to, or copied by, child pornography defendants or their attorneys.\u201c(F) It is imperative to prohibit the reproduction of child pornography in criminal cases so as to avoid repeated violation and abuse of victims, so long as the government makes reasonable accommodations for the inspection, viewing, and exam", "ination of such material for the purposes of mounting a criminal defense.\u201dPub. L. 108\u201321, title V, \u00a7\u202f501Apr. 30, 2003117 Stat. 676\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to protection under the First Amendment under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may be prohibited.\u201c(2) The Government has a compelling state interest in protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, including both child molesters and child pornographers. \u2018The prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance,\u2019 New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982), and this interest extends to stamping out the vice of child pornography at all levels in the distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 (1990).\u201c(3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child pornography remain enforceable and effective. \u2018The most expeditious if not the only practical method of law enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.\u2019 Ferber, 458 U.S. at 760.\u201c(4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the technology did not exist to\u2014\u201c(A) computer generate depictions of children that are indistinguishable from depictions of real children;\u201c(B) use parts of images of real children to create a composite image that is unidentifiable as a particular child and in a way that prevents even an expert from concluding that parts of images of real children were used; or\u201c(C) disguise pictures of real children being abused by making the image look computer-generated.\u201c(5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and to m", "ake depictions of real children appear computer-generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not already, to computer generate realistic images of children.\u201c(6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions today involve images contained on computer hard drives, computer disks, and/or related media.\u201c(7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child pornography images being trafficked today were made other than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless, technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography they possess are not those of real children, insisting that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the images are not computer-generated. Such challenges increased significantly after the decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002).\u201c(8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers and has been transferred over the Internet, often in different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a paper version into a digital format, this task can be even harder since proper forensic assessment may depend on the quality of the image scanned and the tools used to scan it.\u201c(9) The impact of the Free Speech Coalition decision on the Government\u2019s ability to prosecute child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically identify the chi", "ld in the depiction or otherwise identify the origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision, prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed concern about the continued viability of previously indicted cases as well as declined potentially meritorious prosecutions.\u201c(10) Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Free Speech Coalition, defendants in child pornography cases have almost universally raised the contention that the images in question could be virtual, thereby requiring the government, in nearly every child pornography prosecution, to find proof that the child is real. Some of these defense efforts have already been successful. In addition, the number of prosecutions being brought has been significantly and adversely affected as the resources required to be dedicated to each child pornography case now are significantly higher than ever before.\u201c(11) Leading experts agree that, to the extent that the technology exists to computer generate realistic images of child pornography, the cost in terms of time, money, and expertise is\u2014and for the foreseeable future will remain\u2014prohibitively expensive. As a result, for the foreseeable future, it will be more cost-effective to produce child pornography using real children. It will not, however, be difficult or expensive to use readily available technology to disguise those depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable or to make them appear computer-generated.\u201c(12) Child pornography results from the abuse of real children by sex offenders; the production of child pornography is a byproduct of, and not the primary reason for, the sexual abuse of children. There is no evidence that the future development of easy and inexpensive means of computer generating realistic images of children would stop or even reduce the sexual abuse of real children or the practice of visually reco", "rding that abuse.\u201c(13) In the absence of congressional action, the difficulties in enforcing the child pornography laws will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere prospect that the technology exists to create composite or computer-generated depictions that are indistinguishable from depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess images of real children to escape prosecution; for it threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of computer images even when a real child was abused. This threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real children unenforceable. Moreover, imposing an additional requirement that the Government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the image was in fact a real child\u2014as some courts have done\u2014threatens to result in the de facto legalization of the possession, receipt, and distribution of child pornography for all except the original producers of the material.\u201c(14) To avoid this grave threat to the Government\u2019s unquestioned compelling interest in effective enforcement of the child pornography laws that protect real children, a statute must be adopted that prohibits a narrowly-defined subcategory of images.\u201c(15) The Supreme Court\u2019s 1982 Ferber v. New York decision holding that child pornography was not protected drove child pornography off the shelves of adult bookstores. Congressional action is necessary now to ensure that open and notorious trafficking in such materials does not reappear, and even increase, on the Internet.\u201dPub. L. 104\u2013208, div.

a child who is reluctant to engage in sexual activity with an adult, or to pose for sexually explicit photographs, can sometimes be convinced by viewing depictions of other children \u2018having fun\u2019 participating in such activity;\u201c(4) child pornography is often used by pedophiles and child sexual abusers to stimulate and whet their own sexual appetites, and as a model for sexual acting out with children; such use of child pornography can desensitize the viewer to the pathology of sexual abuse or exploitation of children, so that it can become acceptable to and even preferred by the viewer;\u201c(5) new photographic and computer imagining [sic] technologies make it possible to produce by electronic, mechanical, or other means, visual depictions of what appear to be children engaging in sexually explicit conduct that are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct;\u201c(6) computers and computer imaging technology can be used to\u2014\u201c(A) alter sexually explicit photographs, films, and videos in such a way as to make it virtually impossible for unsuspecting viewers to identify individuals, or to determine if the offending material was produced using children;\u201c(B) produce visual depictions of child sexual activity designed to satisfy the preferences of individual child molesters, pedophiles, and pornography collectors; and\u201c(C) alter innocent pictures of children to create visual depictions of those children engaging in sexual conduct;\u201c(7) the creation or distribution of child pornography which includes an image of a recognizable minor invades the child\u2019s privacy and reputational interests, since images that are created showing a child\u2019s face or other identifiable feature on a body engaging in sexually explicit conduct can", " haunt the minor for years to come;\u201c(8) the effect of visual depictions of child sexual activity on a child molester or pedophile using that material to stimulate or whet his own sexual appetites, or on a child where the material is being used as a means of seducing or breaking down the child\u2019s inhibitions to sexual abuse or exploitation, is the same whether the child pornography consists of photographic depictions of actual children or visual depictions produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or other means, including by computer, which are virtually indistinguishable to the unsuspecting viewer from photographic images of actual children;\u201c(9) the danger to children who are seduced and molested with the aid of child sex pictures is just as great when the child pornographer or child molester uses visual depictions of child sexual activity produced wholly or in part by electronic, mechanical, or other means, including by computer, as when the material consists of unretouched photographic images of actual children engaging in sexually explicit conduct;\u201c(10)(A) the existence of and traffic in child pornographic images creates the potential for many types of harm in the community and presents a clear and present danger to all children;

L. 115\u2013299, \u00a7\u202f2Dec. 7, 2018132 Stat. 4383\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) The demand for child pornography harms children because it drives production, which involves severe child sexual abuse and exploitation.\u201c(2) The harms caused by child pornography begin, but do not end, with child sex assault because child pornography is a permanent record of that abuse and trafficking in those images compounds the harm to the child.\u201c(3) In Paroline v. United States (2014), the Supreme Court recognized that \u2018every viewing of child pornography is a repetition of the victim\u2019s abuse\u2019.\u201c(4) The American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children has stated that for victims of child pornography, \u2018the sexual abuse of the child, the memorialization of that abuse which becomes child pornography, and its subsequent distribution and viewing become psychologically intertwined and each compound the harm suffered by the child-victim\u2019.\u201c(5) Victims suffer continuing and grievous harm as a result of knowing that a large, indeterminate number of individuals have viewed and will in the future view images of their childhood sexual abuse. Harms of this sort are a major reason that child pornography is outlawed.\u201c(6) The unlawful collective conduct of every individual who reproduces, distributes, or possesses the images of a victim\u2019s childhood sexual abuse plays a part in sustaining and aggravating the harms to that individual victim.\u201c(7) It is the intent of Congress that victims of child pornography be compensated for the harms resulting from every perpetrator who contributes to their anguish. Such an aggregate causation standard reflects the nature of child pornography and the unique ways that it actually harms victims.\u201d \u00a7\u202f2259A. Assessments in child pornography case", "s(a) In GeneralIn addition to any other criminal penalty, restitution, or special assessment authorized by law, the court shall assess\u2014(1) not more than $17,000 on any person convicted of an offense under section 2252(a)(4) or 2252A(a)(5);(2) not more than $35,000 on any person convicted of any other offense for trafficking in child pornography; and(3) not more than $50,000 on any person convicted of a child pornography production offense.(b) Annual AdjustmentThe dollar amounts in subsection (a) shall be adjusted annually in conformity with the Consumer Price Index.(c) Factors ConsideredIn determining the amount of the assessment under subsection (a), the court shall consider the factors set forth in sections 3553(a) and 3572.(d) Imposition and Implementation.\u2014(1) In generalThe provisions of subchapter C of chapter 227 (other than section 3571) and subchapter B of chapter 229 (relating to fines) apply to assessments under this section, except that paragraph (2) applies in lieu of any contrary provisions of law relating to fines or disbursement of money received from a defendant.(2) Effect on other penaltiesImposition of an assessment under this section does not relieve a defendant of, or entitle a defendant to reduce the amount of any other penalty by the amount of the assessment. Any money received from a defendant shall be disbursed so that each of the following obligations is paid in full in the following sequence:(A) A special assessment under section 3013.(B) Restitution to victims of any child pornography production or trafficking offense that the defendant committed.(C) An assessment under this section.(D) Other orders under any other section of this title.(E) All other fines, penalties, costs, and other payments required under the sentence.(Added Pub.

And every 9 minutes, that victim is a child. Meanwhile, only 25 out of every 1,000 perpetrators will end up in prison.\u201c(3) The effects of child sexual abuse can be long-lasting and affect the victim\u2019s mental health.\u201c(4) Victims are more likely than non-victims to experience the following mental health challenges:\u201c(", "A) Victims are about 4 times more likely to develop symptoms of drug abuse.\u201c(B) Victims are about 4 times more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder as adults.\u201c(C) Victims are about 3 times more likely to experience a major depressive episode as adults.\u201c(5) The criminal justice system should and has acted as an important line of defense to protect children and hold perpetrators accountable.\u201c(6) However, the horrific crimes perpetuated by Larry Nassar demonstrate firsthand the loopholes that still exist in the criminal justice system. While Larry Nassar was found guilty of several State-level offenses, he was not charged federally for his illicit sexual contact with minors, despite crossing State and international borders to commit this conduct.\u201c(7) The Department of Justice has also identified a growing trend of Americans who use charitable or missionary work in a foreign country as a cover for sexual abuse of children.\u201c(8) It is the intent of Congress to prohibit Americans from engaging in sexual abuse or exploitation of minors under the guise of work, including volunteer work, with an organization that affects interstate or foreign commerce, such as an international charity.\u201c(9) Federal law does not require that an abuser\u2019s intention to engage in sexual abuse be a primary, significant, dominant, or motivating purpose of the travel.\u201c(10) Child sexual abuse does not require physical contact between the abuser and the child. This is especially true as perpetrators turn increasingly to internet platforms, online chat rooms, and webcams to commit child sexual abuse.\u201c(11) However, a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found the use of a webcam to engage in sexually provocative activity with a minor did not qualify as \u2018sexual activity\u2019.\u201c(12) Congress can address this issue by amending the definition of the term \u2018sexual activity\u2019 to clarify that it does not require interpersonal, physical contact.\u201c(13) It is the duty of Congress to provide clearer guidance to ensure that", " those who commit crimes against children are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d \u00a7\u202f2424.

The same facilities are used for interstate and intrastate communications. There has been extensive wiretapping carried on without legal sanctions, and without the consent of any of the parties to the conversation. Electronic, mechanical, and other intercepting devices are being used to overhear oral conversations made in private, without the consent of any of the parties to such communications. The contents of these communications and evidence derived therefrom are being used by public and private parties as evidence in court and administrative proceedings, and by persons whose activities affect interstate commerce. The possession, manufacture, distribution, advertising, and use of these devices are facilitated by interstate commerce.\u201c(b) In order to protect effectively the privacy of wire and oral communications, to protect the integrity of court and administrative proceedings, and to prevent the obstruction of interstate commerce, it is necessary for Congress to define on a uniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized, to prohibit any unauthorized interception of such communications, and the use of the contents thereof in evidence in courts and administrative proceedings.\u201c(c) Organized criminals make extensive use of wire and oral communications in their criminal activities. The interception of such communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice.\u201c(d) To safeguard the privacy of innocent persons, the interception of wire or oral communications where none of the parties to the communication has consented to the interception shoul", "d be allowed only when authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction and should remain under the control and supervision of the authorizing court. Interception of wire and oral communications should further be limited to certain major types of offenses and specific categories of crime with assurances that the interception is justified and that the information obtained thereby will not be misused.\u201dNational Commission for the Review of Federal and State Laws Relating to Wiretapping and Electronic SurveillancePub.

Neither the Federal Public Defender nor any attorney so appointed by him may engage in the private practice of law. Each organization shall submit to the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, at the time and in the form prescribed by him, reports of its activities and financial position and its proposed budget.

The Judicial Conference of the United States may, from time to time, issu", "e rules and regulations governing the operation of plans formulated under this section.(i) AppropriationsThere are authorized to be appropriated to the United States courts, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, sums necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, including funds for the continuing education and training of persons providing representational services under this section. When so specified in appropriation acts, such appropriations shall remain available until expended. Payments from such appropriations shall be made under the supervision of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.(j) Districts IncludedAs used in this section, the term \u201cdistrict court\u201d means each district court of the United States created by chapter 5 of title 28, the District Court of the Virgin Islands, the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, and the District Court of Guam.(k) Applicability in the District of ColumbiaThe provisions of this section shall apply in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

For purposes of such subparagraph, a defendant or an essential witness shall be considered unavailable whenever his whereabouts are known but his presence for trial cannot be obtained by due diligence or he resists appearing at or being returned for trial.(4) Any period of delay resulting from the fact tha", "t the defendant is mentally incompetent or physically unable to stand trial.(5) If the information or indictment is dismissed upon motion of the attorney for the Government and thereafter a charge is filed against the defendant for the same offense, or any offense required to be joined with that offense, any period of delay from the date the charge was dismissed to the date the time limitation would commence to run as to the subsequent charge had there been no previous charge.(6) A reasonable period of delay when the defendant is joined for trial with a codefendant as to whom the time for trial has not run and no motion for severance has been granted.(7)(A) Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or his counsel or at the request of the attorney for the Government, if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. No such period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by the court in accordance with this paragraph shall be excludable under this subsection unless the court sets forth, in the record of the case, either orally or in writing, its reasons for finding that the ends of justice served by the granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.(B) The factors, among others, which a judge shall consider in determining whether to grant a continuance under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in any case are as follows:(i) Whether the failure to grant such a continuance in the proceeding would be likely to make a continuation of such proceeding impossible, or result in a miscarriage of justice.(ii) Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, due to the number of defendants, the nature of the prosecution, or the existence of novel questions of fact or law, that it is unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial", " proceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits established by this section.(iii) Whether, in a case in which arrest precedes indictment, delay in the filing of the indictment is caused because the arrest occurs at a time such that it is unreasonable to expect return and filing of the indictment within the period specified in section 3161(b), or because the facts upon which the grand jury must base its determination are unusual or complex.(iv) Whether the failure to grant such a continuance in a case which, taken as a whole, is not so unusual or so complex as to fall within clause (ii), would deny the defendant reasonable time to obtain counsel, would unreasonably deny the defendant or the Government continuity of counsel, or would deny counsel for the defendant or the attorney for the Government the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence.(C) No continuance under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be granted because of general congestion of the court\u2019s calendar, or lack of diligent preparation or failure to obtain available witnesses on the part of the attorney for the Government.(8) Any period of delay, not to exceed one year, ordered by a district court upon an application of a party and a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that an official request, as defined in section 3292 of this title(i) If trial did not commence within the time limitation specified in section 3161 because the defendant had entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere subsequently withdrawn to any or all charges in an indictment or information, the defendant shall be deemed indicted with respect to all charges therein contained within the meaning of section 3161, on the day the order permitting withdrawal of the plea becomes final.(j)(1) If the attorney for the Government knows that a person charged with an offense is serving a term of imprisonment in any penal institution, he shall promptly\u2014(A) undertake to obtain the presence of the prisoner for tria", "l; or(B) cause a detainer to be filed with the person having custody of the prisoner and request him to so advise the prisoner and to advise the prisoner of his right to demand trial.(2) If the person having custody of such prisoner receives a detainer, he shall promptly advise the prisoner of the charge and of the prisoner\u2019s right to demand trial. If at any time thereafter the prisoner informs the person having custody that he does demand trial, such person shall cause notice to that effect to be sent promptly to the attorney for the Government who caused the detainer to be filed.(3) Upon receipt of such notice, the attorney for the Government shall promptly seek to obtain the presence of the prisoner for trial.(4) When the person having custody of the prisoner receives from the attorney for the Government a properly supported request for temporary custody of such prisoner for trial, the prisoner shall be made available to that attorney for the Government (subject, in cases of interjurisdictional transfer, to any right of the prisoner to contest the legality of his delivery).(k)(1) If the defendant is absent (as defined by subsection (h)(3)) on the day set for trial, and the defendant\u2019s subsequent appearance before the court on a bench warrant or other process or surrender to the court occurs more than 21 days after the day set for trial, the defendant shall be deemed to have first appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which the information or indictment is pending within the meaning of subsection (c) on the date of the defendant\u2019s subsequent appearance before the court.(2) If the defendant is absent (as defined by subsection (h)(3)) on the day set for trial, and the defendant\u2019s subsequent appearance before the court on a bench warrant or other process or surrender to the court occurs not more than 21 days after the day set for trial, the time limit required by subsection (c), as extended by subsection (h), shall be further extended by 21 days.(Added Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act of 1998\u2019.\u201cSEC. 202. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) each year, several hundred children are kidnapped by a parent in violation of law, court order, or legally binding agreement and brought to, or taken from, the United States;\u201c(2) until the mid-1970\u2019s, parental abduction generally was not considered a criminal offense in the United States;\u201c(3) since the mid-1970\u2019s, United States criminal law has evolved such that parental abduction is now a criminal offense in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia;\u201c(4) in enacting the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993 (Public Law 103\u2013173107 Stat. 199818 U.S.C. 1204\u201c(5) many of the extradition treaties to which the United States is a party specifically list the offenses that are extraditable and use the word \u2018kidnapping\u2019, but it has been the practice of the United States not to consider the term to include parental abduction because these treaties were negotiated by the United States prior to the development in United States criminal law described in paragraphs (3) and (4);\u201c(6) the more modern extradition treaties to which the United States is a party contain dual criminality provisions, which provide for extradition where both parties make the offense a felony, and therefore it is the practice of the United States to consider such treaties to include parental abduction if the other foreign state party also considers the act of parental abduction to be a criminal offense; and\u201c(7) this circumstance has resulted in a disparity in United States extradition law which should be rectified to better protect the inte", "rests of children and their parents.\u201cSEC. 203. INTERPRETATION OF EXTRADITION TREATIES.\u201cFor purposes of any extradition treaty to which the United States is a party, Congress authorizes the interpretation of the terms \u2018kidnaping\u2019 and \u2018kidnapping\u2019 to include parental kidnapping.\u201dJudicial Assistance to International Tribunal for Yugoslavia and International Tribunal for RwandaPub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018Extradition Treaties Interpretation Act of 1998\u2019. \u201cSEC. 202. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) each year, several hundred children are kidnapped by a parent in violation of law, court order, or legally binding agreement and brought to, or taken from, the United States;\u201c(2) until the mid-1970\u2019s, parental abduction generally was not considered a criminal offense in the United States;\u201c(3) since the mid-1970\u2019s, United States criminal law has ", "evolved such that parental abduction is now a criminal offense in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia;\u201c(4) in enacting the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of 1993 (Public Law 103\u2013173107 Stat. 199818 U.S.C. 1204\u201c(5) many of the extradition treaties to which the United States is a party specifically list the offenses that are extraditable and use the word \u2018kidnapping\u2019, but it has been the practice of the United States not to consider the term to include parental abduction because these treaties were negotiated by the United States prior to the development in United States criminal law described in paragraphs (3) and (4);\u201c(6) the more modern extradition treaties to which the United States is a party contain dual criminality provisions, which provide for extradition where both parties make the offense a felony, and therefore it is the practice of the United States to consider such treaties to include parental abduction if the other foreign state party also considers the act of parental abduction to be a criminal offense; and\u201c(7) this circumstance has resulted in a disparity in United States extradition law which should be rectified to better protect the interests of children and their parents. \u201cSEC. 203. INTERPRETATION OF EXTRADITION TREATIES.\u201cFor purposes of any extradition treaty to which the United States is a party, Congress authorizes the interpretation of the terms \u2018kidnaping\u2019 and \u2018kidnapping\u2019 to include parental kidnapping.\u201d \u00a7\u202f3182.

This permitted the elimination of references to dates and to the provision limiting the application of the section to transactions not yet fully barred. When the provisions of the War Contract Settlements Act of 1944, upon which this section is based, are considered in connection with said section 590a which it amends, it is obvious that no purpose can be served now by the provisions omitted.Phrase (2), reading \u201cor committed in connection with the acquisition, care, handling, custody, control or disposition of any real or personal property of the United States\u201d was derived from section 28 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 which amended said section 590a of title 18The revised section extends its provisions to all offenses involving the disposition of any property, real or personal, of the United States. This extension is more apparent than real since phrase (2), added as the result of said Act, was merely a more specific statement of offenses embraced in phrase (1) of this section.The revised section is written in general terms as permanent legislation applicable whenever the United States is at war. (See, also, reviser\u2019s note under section 284 of this titleThe last paragraph was added to obviate any possibility of doubt as to meaning of terms defined in section 103 of title 41Changes were made in phraseology.Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextSection 103 of title 41act July 1, 1944, ch. 35858 Stat. 650Pub.

In assessing whether a person should be provided protection under this chapter, the Attorney General shall consider the person\u2019s criminal record, alternatives to providing protection under this chapter, the possibility of securing similar testimony from other sources, the need for protecting the person, the relative importance of the person\u2019s testimony, results of psychological examinations, whether providing such protection will subs", "tantially infringe upon the relationship between a child who would be relocated in connection with such protection and that child\u2019s parent who would not be so relocated, and such other factors as the Attorney General considers appropriate.

Civil judgments(a) If a person provided protection under this chapter is named as a defendant in a civil cause of action arising prior to or during the period in which the protection is provided, process in the civil proceeding may be served upon that person or an agent designated by that person for that purpose. The Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts to serve a copy of the process upon the person protected at the person\u2019s last known address. The Attorney General shall notify the plaintiff in the action whether such process has been served. If a judgment in such action is entered against that person the Attorney General shall determine whether the person has made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment. The Attorney General shall take appropriate steps to urge the person to comply with the judgment. If the Attorney General determines that the person has not made reasonable efforts to comply with the judgment, the Attorney General may, after considering the danger to the person and upon the request of the person holding the judgment disclose the identity and location of the person to the plaintiff entitled to recovery pursuant to the judgment. Any such disclosure of the identity and location of the person shall be made upon the express condition that further disclosure by the plaintiff of such identity or location may be made only if essential to the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to recover under the judgment, and only to such additional persons as is necessary to effect the recovery. Any such disclosure or nondisclosure by the Attorney General shall not subject the United States ", "and its officers or employees to any civil liability.(b)(1) Any person who holds a judgment entered by a Federal or State court in his or her favor against a person provided protection under this chapter may, upon a decision by the Attorney General to deny disclosure of the current identity and location of such protected person, bring an action against the protected person in the United States district court in the district where the person holding the judgment (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the \u201cpetitioner\u201d) resides. Such action shall be brought within one hundred and twenty days after the petitioner requested the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of the protected person. The complaint in such action shall contain statements that the petitioner holds a valid judgment of a Federal or State court against a person provided protection under this chapter and that the petitioner sought to enforce the judgment by requesting the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of the protected person.(2) The petitioner in an action described in paragraph (1) shall notify the Attorney General of the action at the same time the action is brought. The Attorney General shall appear in the action and shall affirm or deny the statements in the complaint that the person against whom the judgment is allegedly held is provided protection under this chapter and that the petitioner requested the Attorney General to disclose the identity and location of the protected person for the purpose of enforcing the judgment.(3) Upon a determination (A) that the petitioner holds a judgment entered by a Federal or State court and (B) that the Attorney General has declined to disclose to the petitioner the current identity and location of the protected person against whom the judgment was entered, the court shall appoint a guardian to act on behalf of the petitioner to enforce the judgment. The clerk of the court shall forthwith furnish the guardian with a copy of the order of appointment. The Attorne", "y General shall disclose to the guardian the current identity and location of the protected person and any other information necessary to enable the guardian to carry out his or her duties under this subsection.(4) It is the duty of the guardian to proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch to enforce the rights of the petitioner under the judgment. The guardian shall, however, endeavor to carry out such enforcement duties in a manner that maximizes, to the extent practicable, the safety and security of the protected person. In no event shall the guardian disclose the new identity or location of the protected person without the permission of the Attorney General, except that such disclosure may be made to a Federal or State court in order to enforce the judgment. Any good faith disclosure made by the guardian in the performance of his or her duties under this subsection shall not create any civil liability against the United States or any of its officers or employees.(5) Upon appointment, the guardian shall have the power to perform any act with respect to the judgment which the petitioner could perform, including the initiation of judicial enforcement actions in any Federal or State court or the assignment of such enforcement actions to a third party under applicable Federal or State law. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply in any action brought under this subsection to enforce a Federal or State court judgment.(6) The costs of any action brought under this subsection with respect to a judgment, including any enforcement action described in paragraph (5), and the compensation to be allowed to a guardian appointed in any such action shall be fixed by the court and shall be apportioned among the parties as follows: the petitioner shall be assessed in the amount the petitioner would have paid to collect on the judgment in an action not arising under the provisions of this subsection; the protected person shall be assessed the costs which are normally charged to debtors in similar actions and an", "y other costs which are incurred as a result of an action brought under this subsection. In the event that the costs and compensation to the guardian are not met by the petitioner or by the protected person, the court may, in its discretion, enter judgment against the United States for costs and fees reasonably incurred as a result of the action brought under this subsection.(7) No officer or employee of the Department of Justice shall in any way impede the efforts of a guardian appointed under this subsection to enforce the judgment with respect to which the guardian was appointed.(c) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a court order to which section 3524 of this title(Added Pub.

Child custody arrangements(a) The Attorney General may not relocate any child in connection with protection provided to a person under this chapter if it appears that a person other than that protected person has legal custody of that child.(b) Before protection is provided under this chapter to any person (1) who is a parent of a child of whom that person has custody, and (2) who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a court order, the Attorney General shall obtain and examine a copy of such order for the purpose of assuring that compliance with the order can be achieved. If compliance with a visitation order cannot be achieved, the Attorney General may provide protection under this chapter to the person only if the parent being relocated initiates legal action to modify the existing court order under subsection (e)(1) of this section. The parent being relocated must agree in writin", "g before being provided protection to abide by any ensuing court orders issued as a result of an action to modify.(c) With respect to any person provided protection under this chapter (1) who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such protection and (2) who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a State court order, the Attorney General shall, as soon as practicable after the person and child are so relocated, notify in writing the child\u2019s parent who is not so relocated that the child has been provided protection under this chapter. The notification shall also include statements that the rights of the parent not so relocated to visitation or custody, or both, under the court order shall not be infringed by the relocation of the child and the Department of Justice responsibility with respect thereto. The Department of Justice will pay all reasonable costs of transportation and security incurred in insuring that visitation can occur at a secure location as designated by the United States Marshals Service, but in no event shall it be obligated to pay such costs for visitation in excess of thirty days a year, or twelve in number a year. Additional visitation may be paid for, in the discretion of the Attorney General, by the Department of Justice in extraordinary circumstances. In the event that the unrelocated parent pays visitation costs, the Department of Justice may, in the discretion of the Attorney General, extend security arrangements associated with such visitation.(d)(1) With respect to any person provided protection under this chapter (A) who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such protection and (B) who has obligations to another parent of that child with respect to custody or visitation of that child under a court order, an action to modify that court order may be brought by any party to the court order in the District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for the distri", "ct in which the child\u2019s parent resides who has not been relocated in connection with such protection.(2) With respect to actions brought under paragraph (1), the district courts shall establish a procedure to provide a reasonable opportunity for the parties to the court order to mediate their dispute with respect to the order. The court shall provide a mediator for this purpose. If the dispute is mediated, the court shall issue an order in accordance with the resolution of the dispute.(3) If, within sixty days after an action is brought under paragraph (1) to modify a court order, the dispute has not been mediated, any party to the court order may request arbitration of the dispute. In the case of such a request, the court shall appoint a master to act as arbitrator, who shall be experienced in domestic relations matters. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to masters appointed under this paragraph. The court and the master shall, in determining the dispute, give substantial deference to the need for maintaining parent-child relationships, and any order issued by the court shall be in the best interests of the child. In actions to modify a court order brought under this subsection, the court and the master shall apply the law of the State in which the court order was issued or, in the case of the modification of a court order issued by a district court under this section, the law of the State in which the parent resides who was not relocated in connection with the protection provided under this chapter. The costs to the Government of carrying out a court order may be considered in an action brought under this subsection to modify that court order but shall not outweigh the relative interests of the parties themselves and the child.(4) Until a court order is modified under this subsection, all parties to that court order shall comply with their obligations under that court order subject to the limitations set forth in subsection (c) of this section.(5) With respect to any person provided pr", "otection under this chapter who is the parent of a child who is relocated in connection with such protection, the parent not relocated in connection with such protection may bring an action, in the District Court for the District of Columbia or in the district court for the district in which that parent resides, for violation by that protected person of a court order with respect to custody or visitation of that child. If the court finds that such a violation has occurred, the court may hold in contempt the protected person. Once held in contempt, the protected person shall have a maximum of sixty days, in the discretion of the Attorney General, to comply with the court order. If the protected person fails to comply with the order within the time specified by the Attorney General, the Attorney General shall disclose the new identity and address of the protected person to the other parent and terminate any financial assistance to the protected person unless otherwise directed by the court.(6) The United States shall be required by the court to pay litigation costs, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, incurred by a parent who prevails in enforcing a custody or visitation order; but shall retain the right to recover such costs from the protected person.(e)(1) In any case in which the Attorney General determines that, as a result of the relocation of a person and a child of whom that person is a parent in connection with protection provided under this chapter, the implementation of a court order with respect to custody or visitation of that child would be substantially impossible, the Attorney General may bring, on behalf of the person provided protection under this chapter, an action to modify the court order. Such action may be brought in the district court for the district in which the parent resides who would not be or was not relocated in connection with the protection provided under this chapter. In an action brought under this paragraph, if the Attorney General establishes, by clear and convincing evidence, ", "that implementation of the court order involved would be substantially impossible, the court may modify the court order but shall, subject to appropriate security considerations, provide an alternative as substantially equivalent to the original rights of the nonrelocating parent as feasible under the circumstances.(2) With respect to any State court order in effect to which this section applies, and with respect to any district court order in effect which is issued under this section, if the parent who is not relocated in connection with protection provided under this chapter intentionally violates a reasonable security requirement imposed by the Attorney General with respect to the implementation of that court order, the Attorney General may bring an action in the district court for the district in which that parent resides to modify the court order. The court may modify the court order if the court finds such an intentional violation.(3) The procedures for mediation and arbitration provided under subsection (d) of this section shall not apply to actions for modification brought under this subsection.(f) In any case in which a person provided protection under this chapter is the parent of a child of whom that person has custody and has obligations to another parent of that child concerning custody and visitation of that child which are not imposed by court order, that person, or the parent not relocated in connection with such protection, may bring an action in the district court of the district in which that parent not relocated resides to obtain an order providing for custody or visitation, or both, of that child. In any such action, all the provisions of subsection (d) of this section shall apply.(g) In any case in which an action under this section involves court orders from different States with respect to custody or visitation of the same child, the court shall resolve any conflicts by applying the rules of conflict of laws of the State in which the court is sitting.(h)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the co", "sts of any action described in subsection (d), (e), or (f) of this section shall be paid by the United States.(2) The Attorney General shall insure that any State court order in effect to which this section applies and any district court order in effect which is issued under this section are carried out. The Department of Justice shall pay all costs and fees described in subsections (c) and (d) of this section.(i) As used in this section, the term \u201cparent\u201d includes any person who stands in the place of a parent by law.(Added Pub.

Imposition of a sentence of fine and related matters(a) Factors To Be ConsideredIn determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount, time for payment, and method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)\u2014(1) the defendant\u2019s income, earning capacity, and financial resources;(2) the burden that the fine will impose upon the defendant, any person who is financially dependent on the defendant, or any other person (including a government) that would be responsible for the welfare of any person financially d", "ependent on the defendant, relative to the burden that alternative punishments would impose;(3) any pecuniary loss inflicted upon others as a result of the offense;(4) whether restitution is ordered or made and the amount of such restitution;(5) the need to deprive the defendant of illegally obtained gains from the offense;(6) the expected costs to the government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation component of the sentence;(7) whether the defendant can pass on to consumers or other persons the expense of the fine; and(8) if the defendant is an organization, the size of the organization and any measure taken by the organization to discipline any officer, director, employee, or agent of the organization responsible for the offense and to prevent a recurrence of such an offense.(b) Fine Not to Impair Ability to Make RestitutionIf, as a result of a conviction, the defendant has the obligation to make restitution to a victim of the offense, other than the United States, the court shall impose a fine or other monetary penalty only to the extent that such fine or penalty will not impair the ability of the defendant to make restitution.(c) Effect of Finality of JudgmentNotwithstanding the fact that a sentence to pay a fine can subsequently be\u2014(1) modified or remitted under section 3573;(2) corrected under rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and section 3742; or(3) appealed and modified under section 3742;a judgment that includes such a sentence is a final judgment for all other purposes.(d) Time, Method of Payment, and Related Items(1) A person sentenced to pay a fine or other monetary penalty, including restitution, shall make such payment immediately, unless, in the interest of justice, the court provides for payment on a date certain or in installments.

Special hearing to determine whether a sentence of death is justified(a) Notice by the GovernmentIf, in a case involving an offense described in section 3591, the attorney for the government believes that the circumstances of the offense are such that a sentence of death is justified under this chapter, the attorney shall, a reasonable time before the trial or before acceptance by the court of a plea of guilty, sign and file with the court, and serve on the defendant, a notice\u2014(1) stating that the government believes that the circumstances of the offense are such that, if the defendant is convicted, a sentence of death is justified under this chapter and that the government will seek the sentence of death; and(2) setting forth the aggravating factor or factors that the government, if the defendant is convicted, proposes to prove as justifying a sentence of death.The factors for which notice is provided under this subsection may include factors concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim\u2019s family, and may include oral testimony, a victim impact statement that identifies the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss suffered by the victim and the victim\u2019s family, and any other relevant information. The court may permit the attorney for the government to amend the notice upon a showing of good cause.(b) Hearing Before a Court or JuryIf the a", "ttorney for the government has filed a notice as required under subsection (a) and the defendant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to an offense described in section 3591, the judge who presided at the trial or before whom the guilty plea was entered, or another judge if that judge is unavailable, shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the punishment to be imposed. The hearing shall be conducted\u2014(1) before the jury that determined the defendant\u2019s guilt;(2) before a jury impaneled for the purpose of the hearing if\u2014(A) the defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty;(B) the defendant was convicted after a trial before the court sitting without a jury;(C) the jury that determined the defendant\u2019s guilt was discharged for good cause; or(D) after initial imposition of a sentence under this section, reconsideration of the sentence under this section is necessary; or(3) before the court alone, upon the motion of the defendant and with the approval of the attorney for the government.A jury impaneled pursuant to paragraph (2) shall consist of 12 members, unless, at any time before the conclusion of the hearing, the parties stipulate, with the approval of the court, that it shall consist of a lesser number.(c) Proof of Mitigating and Aggravating FactorsNotwithstanding rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, when a defendant is found guilty or pleads guilty to an offense under section 3591, no presentence report shall be prepared.

Information presented may include the trial transcript and exhibits if the hearing is held before a jury or judge not present during the trial, or at the trial judge\u2019s discretion. The defendant may present any information relevant to a mitigating factor. The government may present any information relevant to an aggravating factor for which notice has been provided", " under subsection (a). Information is admissible regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing admission of evidence at criminal trials except that information may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.

The burden of establishing the existence of any aggravating factor is on the government, and is not satisfied unless the existence of such a factor is established beyond a reasonable doubt.

If no aggravating factor set forth in section 3592 is found to exist, the court shall impose a sentence other than death authorized by law.(e) Return of a Finding Concerning a Sentence of DeathIf, in the case of\u2014(1) an offense described in section 3591(a)(1), an aggravating factor required to be considered under section 3592(b) is found to exist;(2) an offense described in section 3591(a)(2), an aggravating factor required to be considered under section 3592(c) is found to exist; or(3) an offense described in section 3591(b), an aggravating factor required to be considered under section 3592(d) is found to exist,the jury, or if there is no jury, the court, shall consider whether all the aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating factor or factors found to exist to justify a sentence of death, or, in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether the aggravating factor or factors alone are sufficient to justify a sentence of death. Based upon this consideration, the jury by unanimous vote, or if there is no jury, the court, shall recommend whether the defendant should be sentenced to death, to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other lesser sentence.(f) Special Precaution To Ensure Against DiscriminationIn a hearing held before a jury, the court, prior to the return of a finding under subsection (e), shall instruct the jury that, in considering whether a sentence of death is justified, it shall not consider the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim and that the jury is not to recommend a sentence of death unless it has concluded that it would recommend a sentence of death for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim may be. The jury, upon return of a finding under subsection (e), shall ", "also return to the court a certificate, signed by each juror, that consideration of the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim was not involved in reaching his or her individual decision and that the individual juror would have made the same recommendation regarding a sentence for the crime in question no matter what the race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or any victim may be.(Added Pub.
