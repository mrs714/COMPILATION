Congressional statement of findings and purpose\nThe economic and financial structure of this country in combination with the Nation\u2019s natural resources and the productivity of the American people has produced one of the highest average standards of living in the world. However, the Nation has been experiencing inflation and unemployment together with an increasing gap between producers\u2019 prices and consumers\u2019 purchasing power. This has resulted in a growing number of our citizens, especially the elderly, the poor, and the inner city resident, being unable to share in the fruits of our Nation\u2019s highly efficient economic system. The Congress finds that user-owned cooperatives are a proven method for broadening ownership and control of the economic organizations, increasing the number of market participants, narrowing price spreads, raising the quality of goods and services available to their membership, and building bridges between producers and consumers, and th", "eir members and patrons. The Congress also finds that consumer and other types of self-help cooperatives have been hampered in their formation and growth by lack of access to adequate cooperative credit facilities and lack of technical assistance. Therefore, the Congress finds a need for the establishment of a National Consumer Cooperative Bank which will make available necessary financial and technical assistance to cooperative self-help endeavors as a means of strengthening the Nation\u2019s economy.(Pub.

Findings and purpose(a) The Congress finds that\u2014(1) disparate State laws under which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development forecloses multifamily mortgages burden the programs administered by the Secretary pursuant to these authorities, and cause detriment to the residents of the affected projects and the community generally;(2) long periods to complete the foreclosure of these mortgages under certain State laws lead to deterioration in the condition of the properties involved; necessitate substantial Federal management and holding expenditures; increase the risk of vandalism, fire loss, depreciation, damage, and waste with respect to the properties; and adversely affect the residents of the projects and the neighborhoods in which the properties are located;(3) these conditions seriously impair the Secretary\u2019s ability to protect the Federal financial interest in the affected properties and frustrate attainment of the objectives of the underlying Federal program authorities, as well as the national housing goal of \u201ca decent home and ", "a suitable living environment for every American family\u201d;(4) application of State redemption periods to these mortgages following their foreclosure would impair the salability of the properties involved and discourage their rehabilitation and improvement, thereby compounding the problems referred to in clause (3);(5) the availability of a uniform and more expeditious procedure for the foreclosure of these mortgages by the Secretary and continuation of the practice of not applying postsale redemption periods to such mortgages will tend to ameliorate these conditions; and(6) providing the Secretary with a nonjudicial foreclosure procedure will reduce unnecessary litigation by removing many foreclosures from the courts where they contribute to overcrowded calendars.(b) The purpose of this chapter is to create a uniform Federal foreclosure remedy for multifamily mortgages.(Pub.

Findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) the disparate State laws under which mortgages are foreclosed on behalf of the Secretary covering 1- to 4-family residential properties\u2014(A) burden certain programs administered by the Secretary;(B) increase the costs of collecting obligations; and(C) generally are a detriment to the community in which the properties are located;(2) the long periods required to complete the foreclosure of such mortgages under certain State laws\u2014(A) lead to deterioration in the condition of the properties involved;(B) necessitate substantial Federal holding expenditures;(C) increase the risk of vandalism, fire loss, depreciation, damage, and waste with respect to the properties; and(D) adversely affect the neighborhoods in which the properties are located;(3) these conditions seriously impair the ability of the Secretary to protect the Federal financial interest in the affected properties and frustrate attainment of the objectives of the underlying Federal program authority;(4) the availability of uniform and more expeditious procedures, with no right of redemption in the mortgagor or others, for the foreclosure of these mortgages by the Secretary will tend to ameliorate these conditions; and(5) providing the Secretary with a nonjudicial foreclosure procedure will reduce unnecessary litigation by removing many foreclosures from the courts if they contribute to overcrowded calendars.(b) PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to create a uniform Federal foreclosure remedy for single family mortgages that\u2014(1) are held by the Secretary pursuant to title I or title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1702(2) secure loans obligated by the Secretary under section 1452b\u202f11(Pub.
