The effect of establishing their rank with respect to regular officers, when read in connection with the provisions prescribing the rank of officers of the regular components with officers of the other services, under 10:517 (less last sentence), 34:241a (less last sentence), and 34:241, is therefore to establish the rank of nonregular officers with respect to officers of the other listed services. This allows a consolidation of 10:517 (less last sentence, as applicable to rank), 34:241, and 34:241a (less last sentence, as applicable to rank), together with 34:651, into a table of rank among officers of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.

The words \u201cwhether on the active or retired list\u201d, in 34:241, are omitted, since retired officers of the Navy continue to be officers of the Navy. The words \u201cLieutenant (junior grade)\u201d are substituted for the word \u201cmasters\u201d, in R.S. 1466, to reflect the change made in the name of that grade by the Act of March 3, 1883, ch. 9722 Stat. 472In sub", "sections (a) and (b), the words \u201centitled to pay\u201d and \u201centitled to the pay\u201d, respectively, are inserted, since rear admiral is one grade with two ranks depending on the amount of pay to which the incumbent is entitled.In subsection (b), the words \u201cin such grades\u201d, in 10:517 and 34:241a, are omitted as surplusage.In subsection (c), the words \u201cA commissioned officer of the Army or the Air Force\u201d are substituted for the words \u201cAll officers of the Army of the United States, including all components thereof\u201d, since rank among officers of the Regular Army and Regular Air Force is determined under sections 3573, 3574, 8573, and 8574 of this title.Editorial NotesAmendments2023\u2014Subsec.

Review and Disposition of Individuals Detained At the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention FacilitiesEx. Ord. No. 13492, Jan. 22, 2009Jan. 30, 2018By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to effect the appropriate disposition of individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (Guantanamo) and promptly to close detention facilities at Guantanamo, consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice, I hereby order as follows:SectionDefinitions(a) \u201cCommon Article 3\u201d means Article 3 of each of the Geneva Conventions.(b) \u201cGeneva Conventions\u201d means:(i) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, Augu", "st 12, 1949(ii) the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, August 12, 1949(iii) the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August 12, 1949(iv) the Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, August 12, 1949(c) \u201cIndividuals currently detained at Guantanamo\u201d and \u201cindividuals covered by this order\u201d mean individuals currently detained by the Department of Defense in facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants.SecFindings(a) Over the past 7 years, approximately 800 individuals whom the Department of Defense has ever determined to be, or treated as, enemy combatants have been detained at Guantanamo. The Federal Government has moved more than 500 such detainees from Guantanamo, either by returning them to their home country or by releasing or transferring them to a third country. The Department of Defense has determined that a number of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo are eligible for such transfer or release.(b) Some individuals currently detained at Guantanamo have been there for more than 6 years, and most have been detained for at least 4 years. In view of the significant concerns raised by these detentions, both within the United States and internationally, prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo and closure of the facilities in which they are detained would further the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and the interests of justice. Merely closing the facilities without promptly determining the appropriate disposition of the individuals detained would not adequately serve those interests. To the extent practicable, the prompt and appropriate disposition of the individuals detained at Guantanamo should precede the closure of the detention facilities at Guantanamo.(c) The individuals currently detained at Guant", "anamo have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Most of those individuals have filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal court challenging the lawfulness of their detention.(d) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch undertake a prompt and thorough review of the factual and legal bases for the continued detention of all individuals currently held at Guantanamo, and of whether their continued detention is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and in the interests of justice. The unusual circumstances associated with detentions at Guantanamo require a comprehensive interagency review.(e) New diplomatic efforts may result in an appropriate disposition of a substantial number of individuals currently detained at Guantanamo.(f) Some individuals currently detained at Guantanamo may have committed offenses for which they should be prosecuted. It is in the interests of the United States to review whether and how any such individuals can and should be prosecuted.(g) It is in the interests of the United States that the executive branch conduct a prompt and thorough review of the circumstances of the individuals currently detained at Guantanamo who have been charged with offenses before military commissions pursuant to the Military Commissions Act of 2006, Public Law 109\u2013366SecJan. 30, 2018SecImmediate Review of All Guantanamo Detentions.(a) Scope and Timing of Review(b) Review Participants(1) the Attorney General, who shall coordinate the Review;(2) the Secretary of Defense;(3) the Secretary of State;(4) the Secretary of Homeland Security;(5) the Director of National Intelligence;(6) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and(7) other officers or full-time or permanent part-time employees of the United States, including employees with intelligence, counterterrorism, military, and legal expertise, as determined by the Attorney General, with the concurrence of the head of the department or agency concerned.(c) Operation ", "of Review(1) Consolidation of Detainee Information(2) Determination of Transfer(3) Determination of Prosecution(4) Determination of Other Disposition(5) Consideration of Issues Relating to Transfer to the United StatesSecDiplomatic EffortsSecHumane Standards of ConfinementSecMilitary CommissionsSecGeneral Provisions(a) Nothing in this order shall prejudice the authority of the Secretary of Defense to determine the disposition of any detainees not covered by this order.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nEx.

It does not create any additional or separate source of detention authority, and it does not affect the scope of detention authority under existing law. Detainees at Guanta\u0301namo have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and nothing in this order is intended to affect the jurisdiction of Federal courts to determine the legality of their detention.(c) In the event detainees covered by this order are transferred from Guanta\u0301namo to another U.S. detention facility where they remain in law of war detention, thi", "s order shall continue to apply to them.SecStandard for Continued DetentionSecPeriodic Review(a) Initial Review(1) Each detainee shall be provided, in writing and in a language the detainee understands, with advance notice of the PRB review and an unclassified summary of the factors and information the PRB will consider in evaluating whether the detainee meets the standard set forth in section 2 of this order. The written summary shall be sufficiently comprehensive to provide adequate notice to the detainee of the reasons for continued detention.(2) The detainee shall be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by a Government-provided personal representative (representative) who possesses the security clearances necessary for access to the information described in subsection (a)(4) of this section. The representative shall advocate on behalf of the detainee before the PRB and shall be responsible for challenging the Government\u2019s information and introducing information on behalf of the detainee. In addition to the representative, the detainee may be assisted in proceedings before the PRB by private counsel, at no expense to the Government.(3) The detainee shall be permitted to (i) present to the PRB a written or oral statement; (ii) introduce relevant information, including written declarations; (iii) answer any questions posed by the PRB; and (iv) call witnesses who are reasonably available and willing to provide information that is relevant and material to the standard set forth in section 2 of this order.(4) The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with other relevant Government agencies, shall compile and provide to the PRB all information in the detainee disposition recommendations produced by the Task Force established under Executive Order 13492 that is relevant to the determination whether the standard in section 2 of this order has been met and on which the Government seeks to rely for that determination.

All mitigating information relevant to that determination must be provided to the PRB.(5) The information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided to the detainee\u2019s representative. In exceptional circumstances where it is necessary to protect national security, including intelligence sources and methods, the PRB may determine that the representative must receive a sufficient substitute or summary, rather than the underlying information. If the detainee is represented by private counsel, the information provided in subsection (a)(4) of this section shall be provided to such counsel unless the Government determines that the need to protect national security, including intelligence sources and methods, or law enforcement or privilege concerns, requires the Government to provide counsel with a sufficient substitute or summary of the information. A sufficient substitute or summary must provide a meaningful opportunity to assist the detainee during the review process.(6) The PRB shall conduct a hearing to consider the information described in subsection (a)(4) of this section, and other relevant information provided by the detainee or the detainee\u2019s representative or counsel, to determine whether the standard in section 2 of this order is met. The PRB shall consider the reliability of any information provided to it in making its determination.(7) The PRB shall make a prompt determination, by consensus and in writing, as to whether the detainee\u2019s continued detention is warranted under the standard in section 2 of this order. If the PRB determines that the standard is not met, the PRB shall also recommend any conditions that relate to the detainee\u2019s transfer. The PRB shall provide a written summary of any final determination in unclassified form to the detainee, in a language the deta", "inee understands, within 30 days of the determination when practicable.(8) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a secretariat to administer the PRB review and hearing process.

Under similar regulations, rules may be prescribed with respect to the suspension of punishments authorized hereunder. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commanding officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general or flag rank in command may delegate his powers under this article to a principal assistant.(b) Subject to subsection (a), any commanding officer may, in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, impose one or more of the following disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial\u2014(1) upon officers of his command\u2014(A) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 30 consecutive days;(B) if imposed by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general or flag rank in command\u2014(i) arrest in quarters for not more than 30 consecutive days;(ii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month\u2019s pay per month for two months;(iii) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days;(iv) detention of not more than one-half of one month\u2019s pay per month for three months;(2) upon other personnel of his command\u2014(A) if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinement for not more than three consecutive days;(B) correctional custody for not more than seven consecutive days;(C) forfeiture of not more than seven days\u2019 pay;(D) reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one w", "ho imposes the reduction;(E) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than 14 consecutive days;(F) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 14 consecutive days;(G) detention of not more than 14 days\u2019 pay;(H) if imposed by an officer of the grade of major or lieutenant commander, or above\u2014(i) the punishment authorized under clause (A);(ii) correctional custody for not more than 30 consecutive days;(iii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month\u2019s pay per month for two months;(iv) reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E\u20134 may not be reduced more than two pay grades;(v) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than 45 consecutive days;(vi) restrictions to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days;(vii) detention of not more than one-half of one month\u2019s pay per month for three months.Detention of pay shall be for a stated period of not more than one year but if the offender\u2019s term of service expires earlier, the detention shall terminate upon that expiration. No two or more of the punishments of arrest in quarters, confinement, correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction may be combined to run consecutively in the maximum amount imposable for each. Whenever any of those punishments are combined to run consecutively, there must be an apportionment. In addition, forfeiture of pay may not be combined with detention of pay without an apportionment. For the purposes of this subsection, \u201ccorrectional custody\u201d is the physical restraint of a person during duty or nonduty hours and may include extra duties, fatigue duties, or hard labor. If practicable, correctional custody will not be served in immediate association with persons", " awaiting trial or held in confinement pursuant to trial by court-martial.(c) An officer in charge may impose upon enlisted members assigned to the unit of which he is in charge such of the punishments authorized under subsection (b)(2)(A)\u2013(G) as the Secretary concerned may specifically prescribe by regulation.(d) The officer who imposes the punishment authorized in subsection (b), or his successor in command, may, at any time, suspend probationally any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend probationally a reduction in grade or a forfeiture imposed under subsection (b), whether or not executed. In addition, he may, at any time, remit or mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. He may also mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay. When mitigating\u2014(1) arrest in quarters to restriction;(2) confinement to correctional custody;(3) correctional custody or confinement to extra duties or restriction, or both; or(4) extra duties to restriction;the mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. When mitigating forfeiture of pay to detention of pay, the amount of the detention shall not be greater than the amount of the forfeiture. When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay, the amount of the forfeiture or detention shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.(e) A person punished under this article who considers his punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel, appeal to the next superior authority. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged.

No. 10780, June 26, 2024Our Nation has made tremendous progress in advancing the cause of equality for LGBTQI+ Americans, including in the military. Despite their courage and great sacrifice, thousands of LGBTQI+ service members were forced out of the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Many of these patriotic Americans were subject to a court-martial. While my Administration has taken meaningful action to remedy these problems, the impact of that historical injustice remains. As Commander in Chief, I am committed to maintaining the finest fighting force in the world. That means making sure that every member of our military feels safe and respected.Accordingly, acting pursuant to the grant of authority in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, I, Joseph R. Biden Jr., do hereby grant a full, complete, and unconditional pardon to persons convicted of unaggravated offenses based on consensual, private conduct with persons age 18 and older under former Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), as previously codified at 10 U.S.C. 92510 U.S.C. 880May 31, 1951December 26, 2013Public Law 113\u201366The purpose of this proclamation is to pardon only offenses based on consensual, private conduct between individuals 18 and older that do not involve any aggravating factor, including:(1) conduct that would violate 10 U.S.C. 893a(2) conduct that was committed with an individual who was coerced or, because of status, might not have felt able to refuse consent;(3) conduct on the part of the applicant constituting fraternization under Article 134 of the", " UCMJ [10 U.S.C. 934(4) conduct committed with the spouse of another military member; or(5) any factors other than those listed above that were identified by the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in United States v. MarcumLawrence v. TexasThe Military Departments (Army, Navy, or Air Force), or in the case of the Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, shall provide information about and publicize application procedures for certificates of pardon. An applicant for a certificate of pardon under this proclamation is to submit an application to the Military Department (Army, Navy, or Air Force) that conducted the court-martial or, in the case of a Coast Guard court-martial, to the Department of Homeland Security. If the relevant Department determines that the applicant satisfies the criteria under this proclamation, following a review of relevant military justice records, the Department shall submit that determination to the Attorney General, acting through the Pardon Attorney, who shall then issue a certificate of pardon along with information on the process to apply for an upgrade of military discharge. My Administration strongly encourages veterans who receive a certificate of pardon to apply for an upgrade of military discharge.Although the pardon under this proclamation applies only to the convictions described above, there are other LGBTQI+ individuals who served our Nation and were convicted of other crimes because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
