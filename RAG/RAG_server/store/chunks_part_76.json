FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) During the Persian Gulf War, members of the Armed Forces were exposed to numerous potentially toxic substances, including fumes and smoke from military operations, oil well fires, diesel exhaust, paints, pesticides, depleted uranium, infectious agents, investigational drugs and vaccines, and indigenous diseases, and were also given multiple immunizations. It is not known whether these servicemembers were exposed to chemical or biological warfare agents. However, threats of enemy use of chemical and biological warfare heightened the psycholo", "gical stress associated with the military operation.\u201c(2) Significant numbers of veterans of the Persian Gulf War are suffering from illnesses, or are exhibiting symptoms of illness, that cannot now be diagnosed or clearly defined. As a result, many of these conditions or illnesses are not considered to be service connected under current law for purposes of benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\u201c(3) The National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Workshop on the Persian Gulf Experience and Health, held in April 1994, concluded that the complex biological, chemical, physical, and psychological environment of the Southwest Asia theater of operations produced complex adverse health effects in Persian Gulf War veterans and that no single disease entity or syndrome is apparent. Rather, it may be that the illnesses suffered by those veterans result from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes that have yet to be defined.\u201c(4) That workshop concluded that the information concerning the range and intensity of exposure to toxic substances by military personnel in the Southwest Asia theater of operations is very limited and that such information was collected only after a considerable delay.\u201c(5) In response to concerns regarding the health-care needs of Persian Gulf War veterans, particularly those who suffer from illnesses or conditions for which no diagnosis has been made, the Congress, in Public Law 102\u2013585section 101 of this titlePublic Law 103\u2013210Public Law 103\u2013160\u201c(6) In response to concerns about the lack of objective research on Gulf War illnesses, Congress included research provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 [Pub. L. 103\u2013337\u201c(7) Further research and studies must be undertaken to determine the underlying causes of the illnesses suffered by Persian Gulf War veterans and, pending the outcome of such research, veterans who are seriously ill as the result of such illnesses should be given the benefit of the doubt and be provided compensa", "tion benefits to offset the impairment in earnings capacities they may be experiencing.\u201cSEC. 103. PURPOSES.\u201cThe purposes of this title [see Short Title of 1994 Amendments note under section 101 of this title\u201c(1) to provide compensation to Persian Gulf War veterans who suffer disabilities resulting from illnesses that cannot now be diagnosed or defined, and for which other causes cannot be identified;\u201c(2) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop at the earliest possible date case assessment strategies and definitions or diagnoses of such illnesses;\u201c(3) to promote greater outreach to Persian Gulf War veterans and their families to inform them of ongoing research activities, as well as the services and benefits to which they are currently entitled; and\u201c(4) to ensure that research activities and accompanying surveys of Persian Gulf War veterans are appropriately funded and undertaken by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\u201cSEC. 104.

FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) During the Persian Gulf War, members of the Armed Forces were exposed to numerous potentially toxic substances, including fumes and smoke from military operations, oil well fires, diesel exhaust, paints, pesticides, depleted uranium, infectious agents, investigational drugs and vaccines, and ind", "igenous diseases, and were also given multiple immunizations. It is not known whether these servicemembers were exposed to chemical or biological warfare agents. However, threats of enemy use of chemical and biological warfare heightened the psychological stress associated with the military operation.\u201c(2) Significant numbers of veterans of the Persian Gulf War are suffering from illnesses, or are exhibiting symptoms of illness, that cannot now be diagnosed or clearly defined. As a result, many of these conditions or illnesses are not considered to be service connected under current law for purposes of benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\u201c(3) The National Institutes of Health Technology Assessment Workshop on the Persian Gulf Experience and Health, held in April 1994, concluded that the complex biological, chemical, physical, and psychological environment of the Southwest Asia theater of operations produced complex adverse health effects in Persian Gulf War veterans and that no single disease entity or syndrome is apparent. Rather, it may be that the illnesses suffered by those veterans result from multiple illnesses with overlapping symptoms and causes that have yet to be defined.\u201c(4) That workshop concluded that the information concerning the range and intensity of exposure to toxic substances by military personnel in the Southwest Asia theater of operations is very limited and that such information was collected only after a considerable delay.\u201c(5) In response to concerns regarding the health-care needs of Persian Gulf War veterans, particularly those who suffer from illnesses or conditions for which no diagnosis has been made, the Congress, in Public Law 102\u2013585section 101 of this titlePublic Law 103\u2013210Public Law 103\u2013160\u201c(6) In response to concerns about the lack of objective research on Gulf War illnesses, Congress included research provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 [Pub. L. 103\u2013337\u201c(7) Further research and studies must be undertaken to determin", "e the underlying causes of the illnesses suffered by Persian Gulf War veterans and, pending the outcome of such research, veterans who are seriously ill as the result of such illnesses should be given the benefit of the doubt and be provided compensation benefits to offset the impairment in earnings capacities they may be experiencing. \u201cSEC. 103. PURPOSES.\u201cThe purposes of this title [see Short Title of 1994 Amendments note under section 101 of this title\u201c(1) to provide compensation to Persian Gulf War veterans who suffer disabilities resulting from illnesses that cannot now be diagnosed or defined, and for which other causes cannot be identified;\u201c(2) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop at the earliest possible date case assessment strategies and definitions or diagnoses of such illnesses;\u201c(3) to promote greater outreach to Persian Gulf War veterans and their families to inform them of ongoing research activities, as well as the services and benefits to which they are currently entitled; and\u201c(4) to ensure that research activities and accompanying surveys of Persian Gulf War veterans are appropriately funded and undertaken by the Department of Veterans Affairs. \u201cSEC. 104.

This Act [amending this section, enacting provisions set out as notes under this section, and amending provisions set out as notes under this section and section 1116 of this title\u201cfindings\u201cSec. 2. The Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and veterans who participated in atmospheric nuclear tests or the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, are deeply concerned about possible long-term health effects of exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.\u201c(2) There is scientific and medical uncertainty regarding such long-term adverse health effects.\u201c(3) In section 102 of Public Law 97\u201322\u201c(4) The Congress has further responded to that medical and scientific uncertainty by requiring, in section 307 of Public Law 96\u2013151section 1116 of this titlesection 601 of Public Law 98\u2013160Public Law 97\u2013414\u201c(5) There is some evidence that most types of leukemia, malignancies of the thyroid, female breast, lung, bone, liver, and skin, and polycythemia vera are associated with exposure to certain levels of ionizing radiation.\u201c(6) As of the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1984\u201c(7) The initial results of one project\u2014an epidemiological study, conducted by the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, of the health status of the \u2018Ranch Hand\u2019 veterans who carried out the loading and aerial spraying of herbicides containing dioxin in Vietnam and in the process came into direct skin contact with such herbicides in their most concentrated liquid form\u2014were released on February 24, 1984\u201c(8) The \u2018film badges\u2019 which were originally issued to members of the Armed Forces in connection with the atmospheric nuclear test program have previously constituted a primary source of dose information for veterans (and survivors of veterans) filing claims for Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Departme", "nt of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation in connection with exposure to radiation.\u201c(9) These film badges often provide an incomplete measure of radiation exposure, since they were not capable of recording inhaled, ingested, or neutron doses (although the Defense Nuclear Agency currently has the capability to reconstruct individual estimates of such doses), were not issued to most of the participants in nuclear tests, often provided questionable readings because they were shielded during the detonation, and were worn for only limited periods during and after each nuclear detonation.\u201c(10) Standards governing the reporting of dose estimates in connection with radiation-related claims for Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation vary among the several branches of the Armed Forces, and no uniform minimum standards exist.\u201c(11) The Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] has not promulgated permanent regulations setting forth specific guidelines, standards, and criteria for the adjudication of claims for Veterans\u2019 Administration disability compensation based on exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.\u201c(12) Such claims (especially those involving health effects with long latency periods) present adjudicatory issues which are significantly different from issues generally presented in claims based upon the usual types of injuries incurred in military service.\u201c(13) It has always been the policy of the Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] and is the policy of the United States, with respect to individual claims for service connection of diseases and disabilities, that when, after consideration of all evidence and material of record, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of a claim, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.\u201cpurpos", "e\u201cSec. 3. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation is provided to veterans who were exposed to ionizing radiation in connection with atmospheric nuclear tests or in connection with the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, for all disabilities arising after that service that are connected, based on sound scientific and medical evidence, to such service (and that Veterans\u2019 Administration dependency and indemnity compensation is provided to survivors of those veterans for all deaths resulting from such disabilities).\u201d[Amendment by Pub.

This Act [amending this section, enacting provisions set out as notes under this section, and amending provisions set out as notes under this section and section 1116 of this title \u201cSec. 2. The Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Veterans who served in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and veterans who participated in atmospheric nuclear tests or the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, are deeply concerned about possible long-term health effects of exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.\u201c(2) There is scientific and medical uncertainty regarding such long-term adverse health effects.\u201c(3) In section 102 of Public Law 97\u201322\u201c(4) The Congress has further responded to that medical and scientific uncertainty by requiring, in section 307 of Public Law 96\u2013151section 1116 of this titlesection 601 of Public Law 98\u2013160Public Law 97\u2013414\u201c(5) There is some evidence that most types of leukemia, malignancies of the thyroid, female breast, lung, bone, liver, and skin, and polycythemia vera are associated with exposure to certain levels of ionizing radiation.\u201c(6) As of the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 24, 1984\u201c(7) The initial results of one project\u2014an epidemiological study, conducted by the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, of the health status of the \u2018Ranch Hand\u2019 veterans who carried out the loading and aerial spraying of herbicides containing dioxin in Vietnam and in the process came", " into direct skin contact with such herbicides in their most concentrated liquid form\u2014were released on February 24, 1984\u201c(8) The \u2018film badges\u2019 which were originally issued to members of the Armed Forces in connection with the atmospheric nuclear test program have previously constituted a primary source of dose information for veterans (and survivors of veterans) filing claims for Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation in connection with exposure to radiation.\u201c(9) These film badges often provide an incomplete measure of radiation exposure, since they were not capable of recording inhaled, ingested, or neutron doses (although the Defense Nuclear Agency currently has the capability to reconstruct individual estimates of such doses), were not issued to most of the participants in nuclear tests, often provided questionable readings because they were shielded during the detonation, and were worn for only limited periods during and after each nuclear detonation.\u201c(10) Standards governing the reporting of dose estimates in connection with radiation-related claims for Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation vary among the several branches of the Armed Forces, and no uniform minimum standards exist.\u201c(11) The Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] has not promulgated permanent regulations setting forth specific guidelines, standards, and criteria for the adjudication of claims for Veterans\u2019 Administration disability compensation based on exposure to herbicides containing dioxin or to ionizing radiation.\u201c(12) Such claims (especially those involving health effects with long latency periods) present adjudicatory issues which are significantly different from issues generally presented in claims based upon the usual types of injuries incurred in military service.\u201c(13) It has always been the policy of the Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] and is the", " policy of the United States, with respect to individual claims for service connection of diseases and disabilities, that when, after consideration of all evidence and material of record, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of a claim, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. \u201cSec. 3. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that Veterans\u2019 Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] disability compensation is provided to veterans who were exposed to ionizing radiation in connection with atmospheric nuclear tests or in connection with the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, for all disabilities arising after that service that are connected, based on sound scientific and medical evidence, to such service (and that Veterans\u2019 Administration dependency and indemnity compensation is provided to survivors of those veterans for all deaths resulting from such disabilities).\u201d \u201cSec. 5.
