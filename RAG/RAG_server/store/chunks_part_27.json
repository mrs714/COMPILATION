Bush.\nEstablishing an Interagency Task Force on Federal Contracting Opportunities for Small BusinessesMemorandum of President of the United States, Apr. 26, 2010Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesThe Federal Government is the world\u2019s largest purchaser of goods and services, with purchases totaling over $500 billion per year. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) and other national investments are providing new opportunities for small businesses to compete for Federal contracts, and it is critical that these investments tap into the talents and skills of a broad cross-section of American business and industry. Small businesses must be able to participate in the Nation\u2019s economic recovery, including businesses owned by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed Forces. These businesses should be able to compete and participate effectively in Federal contracts.The Congress has established a number of statutory goals designed to help small businesses compete for Federal contracts. In addition to the goal of awarding at least 23 percent of all Federal prime contracting dollars to small businesses, the Congress also established Government-wide contracting goals for participation by small businesses that are located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones (at least 3 percent) or that are owned by women (at least 5 percent), socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (at least 5 percent), and service-disabled veterans (at least 3 percent). These aspirational goals help ensure that all Americans share in the jobs and opportunities created by Federal procurement.In recent years, the Federal Government has not consistently reached its small business contracting goals. Although we have made some progress\u2014particularly with respect to Recovery Act contracts\u2014more work can and should be done. I am committed to ensuring that small businesses, including firms o", "wned by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans, have fair access to Federal Government contracting. Indeed, where small businesses have the capacity to do more, we should strive to exceed the statutory goals. While Chief Acquisition Officers and Senior Procurement Executives have many priorities, small business contracting should always be a high priority in the procurement process.Obtaining tangible results will require an honest and accurate accounting of our progress so that we can have transparency and accountability through Federal small business procurement data. Additionally, we must expand outreach strategies to alert small firms to Federal contracting opportunities.In order to coordinate executive departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 efforts towards ensuring that all small businesses have a fair chance to participate in Federal contracting opportunities, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionEstablishmentSecMembership(i) the Secretary of the Treasury;(ii) the Secretary of Defense;(iii) the Attorney General;(iv) the Secretary of Labor;(v) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;(vi) the Secretary of Transportation;(vii) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;(viii) the Secretary of Homeland Security;(ix) the Administrator of General Services;(x) the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;(xi) the Director of the Minority Business Development Agency;(xii) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;(xiii) the Director of the Domestic Policy Council;(xiv) the Director of the National Economic Council;(xv) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers; and(xvi) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the President may, from time to time, designate.A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, one or more senior officials who are part of the member\u2019s department, agency, or office, and who are full-time officers or employees of the Fe", "deral Government.SecFunctions(i) using innovative strategies, such as teaming, to increase opportunities for small business contractors and utilizing and expanding mentorship programs, such as the mentor-prote\u0301ge\u0301 program;(ii) removing barriers to participation by small businesses in the Federal marketplace by unbundling large projects, improving training of Federal acquisition officials with respect to strategies for increasing small business contracting opportunities, and utilizing new technologies to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Federal program managers, acquisition officials, and the Directors of Offices of Small Business Programs and Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, their managers, and procurement center representatives in identifying and providing access to these opportunities;(iii) expanding outreach strategies to match small businesses, including firms located in Historically Underutilized Business Zones and firms owned and controlled by women, minorities, socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and service-disabled veterans of our Armed Forces, with contracting and subcontracting opportunities; and(iv) establishing policies, including revision or clarification of existing legislation, regulations, or policies, that are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the objectives of this memorandum.SecUsing Technology to Improve Transparency and AccountabilitySecOutreachSecGeneral Provisions(b) This memorandum does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(c) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Task Force.

The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.(b) Assistance to small-business concernsIt shall be the duty of the Administration, and it is empowered\u2014(1) to assist small-business concerns to obtain Government contracts for research and development;(2) to assist small-business concerns to obtain the benefits of research and development performed under Government contracts or at Government expense;(3) to provide technical assistance to small-business concerns to accomplish the purposes of th", "is section;(4) to develop and maintain a source file and an information program to assure each qualified and interested small business concern the opportunity to participate in Federal agency small business innovation research programs and small business technology transfer programs;(5) to coordinate with participating agencies a schedule for release of SBIR and STTR solicitations, and to prepare a master release schedule so as to maximize small businesses\u2019 opportunities to respond to solicitations;(6) to independently survey and monitor the operation of SBIR and STTR programs within participating Federal agencies;(7) to report not less than annually to the Committee on Small Business of the Senate, and to the Committee on Science and the Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives, on the SBIR and STTR programs of the Federal agencies and the Administration\u2019s information and monitoring efforts related to the SBIR and STTR programs, including\u2014(A) the data on output and outcomes collected pursuant to subsections (g)(8) and (o(B) the number of proposals received from, and the number and total amount of awards to, HUBZone small business concerns and firms with venture capital, hedge fund, or private equity firm investment (including those majority-owned by multiple venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms) under each of the SBIR and STTR programs;(C) a description of the extent to which each Federal agency is increasing outreach and awards to firms owned and controlled by women or by socially or economically disadvantaged individuals under each of the SBIR and STTR programs;(D) general information about the implementation of, and compliance with the allocation of funds required under, subsection (dd) for firms owned in majority part by venture capital operating companies, hedge funds, or private equity firms and participating in the SBIR program;(E) a detailed description of appeals of Phase III awards and notices of noncompliance with the SBIR Policy Directive and th", "e STTR Policy Directive filed by the Administrator with Federal agencies;(F) an accounting of funds, initiatives, and outcomes under the Commercialization Readiness Program;(G) a description of the extent to which Federal agencies are providing in a timely manner information needed to maintain the database described in subsection (k);(H) with respect to a Federal agency to which subsection (f)(1) or (n)(1) applies, whether the Federal agency has complied with the applicable subsection for the year covered by the report;(I) the number of applications submitted to each Federal agency participating in the SBIR or STTR program in innovation open topics as compared to conventional topics, and how many small business concerns receive funding from open topics compared to conventional topics;(J) the total number and dollar amount, and average size, of awards made by each Federal agency participating in the SBIR or STTR program, by phase, from\u2014(i) open topics;

No. 12142, June 21, 1979July 1, 1979[For abolition of Office of the Federal Inspector for the Alaska Natural Gas T", "ransportation System and transfer of functions and authority, see section 3012(b) of Pub. L. 102\u2013486Message of the PresidentTo the Congress of the United States:I am submitting to you today Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1979 to create the Office of Federal Inspector for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System and establish the position of Federal Inspector. Creation of this Office and the transfer of appropriate Federal enforcement authority and responsibility is consistent with my September 1977 Decision and Report to the Congress on the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System. This decision was approved by the Congress November 2, 1977The Alaska Gas Transportation System is a 4,748-mile pipeline to be constructed in partnership with Canada. Canada completed legislation enacting a similar transfer last year and has already appointed an official to coordinate its activities prior to and during pipeline construction. The Northwest Alaska Pipeline Company has been selected to construct the pipeline, with completion scheduled in late 1984. Estimated construction costs are $10\u2013$15 billion, to be financed by private investment.Natural gas is among the Nation\u2019s most valuable fuels. It is in the national interest to bring Alaskan gas reserves to market at the lowest possible price for consumers. Construction of a gas pipeline from the Prudhoe Bay reserves in Alaska through Canada to points in the West and Midwest United States will provide a system which will deliver more Alaskan natural gas at less cost to a greater number of Americans than any alternative transportation system. Every effort must be made to ensure timely completion of the pipeline at the lowest possible cost consistent with Federal regulatory policies.As a result of our experience in construction of the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, we recognize the need for the Federal Government to be in a strong position to manage its own role in this project through prompt, coordinated decisionmaking in pre-construction approval functions and in enforcing the ter", "ms and conditions of the permits, certificates, leases, and other authorizations to be issued by various Federal agencies. We must avoid duplicating the delays and cost escalations experienced in the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The Plan I am submitting would establish clear responsibility for the efficient functioning of Federal enforcement activities by assigning the Federal Inspector authority to carry out these responsibilities.The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 [15 U.S.C. 719The Decision and Report to the Congress recommended an Executive Policy Board with policy-making and supervisory authority over the Federal Inspector. I plan to sign an Executive Order upon approval of this Plan by the Congress which will create an Executive Policy Board which will be only advisory, but which will enhance communication and coordinate among Federal agencies and with the Federal Inspector. The Plan modifies the Decision and Report in that regard. The Federal Inspector will use the policies and procedures of the agencies involved in exercising the transferred enforcement responsibilities to the maximum extent practicable. The Board provides the opportunity for agencies to contribute to the policy deliberations of the Inspector and exercises an oversight role to insure that pipeline activities are carried on within existing regulatory policy. The Board is required to review the budget of the Office of the Federal Inspector and periodically report to me on the progress of construction and on major problems encountered. I am convinced that the Federal Inspector must have authority commensurate with his responsibilities.Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 515 U.S.C. 719\nJimmy Carter.The White HouseApril 2, 1979\nEx.
