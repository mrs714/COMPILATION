In any such case the Board or the person or reviewing body so established or assigned shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the hearing and of the time and place of the hearing.(2) Any claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied in an initial determination with respect thereto upon the basis of his not being a qualified employee, and any claimant who contends that under an initial determination of his claim he has been awarded benefits at less ", "than the proper rate, may appeal to the Board for the review of such determination. Thereupon the Board shall review the determination and for such review may designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and to report to the Board thereon together with recommendations.

Despite such an appeal, the benefits awarded shall be paid to such claimant, subject to recovery by the Board if and to the extent found on the appeal to have been erroneously awarded. The Board shall take such action as is appropriate to recover the amount of such benefits including if feasible adjustment in subsequent payments pursuant to the first two paragraphs of section 352(d) of this title(4) In any case in which benefits are awarded to a claimant in whole or in part upon the basis of pay earned in the service of a person or company found by the Board to be an employer as defined in this chapter but which denies that it is such an employer, such benefits awarded on such basis shall be paid to such claimant subject to a right of recovery of such benefits. The Board shall thereupon designate one of its officers o", "r employees to receive evidence and to report to the Board on whether such benefits should be repaid. The Board may also designate one of its officers or employees to receive evidence and report to the Board whether or not any person or company is entitled to a refund of contributions or should be required to pay contributions under this chapter, regardless of whether or not any claims for benefits will have been filed upon the basis of service in the employ of such person or company, and shall follow such procedure if contributions are assessed and payment is refused or payment is made and a refund claimed upon the basis that such person or company is or will not have been liable for such contributions. In any such case the Board or the person so designated shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the hearing. At the request of any party properly interested the Board shall provide for a hearing, and may provide for a hearing on its own motion. The Board shall prescribe regulations governing the proceedings provided for in this paragraph and for decisions upon such proceedings.(5) Final decision of the Board in the cases provided for in the preceding three paragraphs shall be communicated to the claimant and to the other interested parties within fifteen days after it is made.

Congressional declaration of policy(a) FindingsThe Congress finds and declares that\u2014(1) Essential rail service in the midwest and northeast region of the United States is provided by railroads which are today insolvent and attempting to undergo reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act.(2) This essential rail service is threatened with cessation or significant curtailment because of the inability of the trustees of such railroads to formulate acceptable plans for reorganization. This rail service is operated over rail properties which were acquired for a public use, but which have been permitted to deteriorate and now require extensive rehabilitation and modernization.(3) The public convenience and necessity require adequate and efficient rail service in this region and throughout the Nation to meet the needs of commerce, the national defense, the environment, and the service requirements of passengers, United States mail, shippers, States and their political subdivisions, and consumers.(4) Continuation and impr", "ovement of essential rail service in this region is also necessary to preserve and maintain adequate national rail services and an efficient national rail transportation system.(5) Rail service and rail transportation offer economic and environmental advantages with respect to land use, air pollution, noise levels, energy efficiency and conservation, resource allocation, safety, and cost per ton-mile of movement to such extent that the preservation and maintenance of adequate and efficient rail service is in the national interest.(6) These needs cannot be met without substantial action by the Federal Government.(b) PurposesIt is therefore declared to be the purpose of Congress in this chapter to provide for\u2014(1) the identification of a rail service system in the midwest and northeast region which is adequate to meet the needs and service requirements of this region and of the national rail transportation system;(2) the reorganization of railroads in this region into an economically viable system capable of providing adequate and efficient rail service to the region;(3) the establishment of the United States Railway Association, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;(4) the establishment of the Consolidated Rail Corporation, with enumerated powers and responsibilities;(5) assistance to States and local and regional transportation authorities for continuation of local rail services threatened with cessation; and(6) necessary Federal financial assistance at the lowest possible cost to the general tax\u00adpayer.(Pub.

Continuing reorganization; supplemental transactions(a) ProposalsIf the Secretary or the Association determines that, as part of continuing reorganization, further restructuring of rail properties in the region through transactions supplemental to the final system plan would promote the establishment and retention of a financially self-sustaining rail service system in the region adequate to meet the needs of the region, the Secretary or the Association, as the case may be, may develop proposals for such supplemental transactions as are necessary or appropriate to implement the needed restructuring. Transfers of rail properties included in proposals developed by the Association shall be limited to (1) rail properties which would have qualified for designation under section 716(c)(1)(A) of this title(b) Evaluation by AssociationThe Association shall analyze each proposal containing one or more supplemental transactions, taking into account the comments of interested persons and statements and exhibits submitted at any public hearings which may have been held. The Association shall, within 120 days after the publication of a summary thereof under subsection (a) of this section, publish in the Federal Register a report evaluating such proposal. Such evaluation shall state whether the supplemental transactions contained in such proposal, considered in their entirety, are (1) in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan, and (2) fair and equitable. If the Corporation opposes, or seeks modification of, any such proposed transfer, its written comments shall be given due consideration by the Association and shall be published as part of the evaluation. Within 30 days after the Association publishes its report, each proposed transferor or transferee shall notify the Association in writing as to whether an", "y proposed supplemental transaction requiring the transfer of any property from or to such transferor or transferee is acceptable to such proposed transferor or transferee. If any such proposed transferor (other than the Corporation) or transferee fails to notify the Association that any proposed supplemental transaction requiring the transfer of any property from such transferor or to such transferee is acceptable to it, no further administrative or judicial proceedings shall be conducted with respect to such proposed supplemental transaction.(c) Review by CommissionWithin 90 days after the publication in the Federal Register of each report referred to in subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall determine whether the supplemental transactions referred to in the report, considered in their entirety, would be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan. In making such determination, the Commission shall give due consideration to the views received by it, within 30 days after the publication of the applicable report, from the Corporation and the Secretary. The Commission may condition its approval of such supplemental transactions on such reasonable terms and conditions as it may deem necessary in the public interest. The approval by the Commission of such supplemental transactions shall not be a prerequisite to the consummation of such transactions, but any determination of the Commission modifying, approving, or disapproving any proposed supplemental transactions shall be given due weight and consideration by the special court in the proceedings prescribed in subsection (d) of this section. If the Commission fails to act within the time period provided in this subsection, the supplemental transactions involved shall be deemed to have been approved by the Commission.

If the Association has determined, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section that a proposal made by the Secretary is not in the public interest or is not consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan or is not fair and equitable, the Secretary may, if he determines that such proposal is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan and is fair and equitable, petition the special court for an order of such court finding that such proposal for supplemental transactions is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan and is fair and equitable, and directing the Corporation to carry out any supplemental transactions specified in such proposal. Such a petition shall be submitted to the special court within 90 days after the date of the Commission\u2019s determination under such subsection (c), or after the expiration of the 90-day period referred to in such subsection (c), whichever is applicable.(2) After the filing of a petition under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the special court shall decide, after a hearing, whether the proposed supp", "lemental transactions contained in such petition, considered in their entirety, are in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan and are fair and equitable. If the special court determines that such proposed supplemental transactions, considered in their entirety, are in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan and are fair and equitable, it shall, upon making such determination, issue such orders as may be necessary to direct the Corporation to consummate the transactions. If the special court determines that such proposed supplemental transactions, considered in their entirety, are not in the public interest or not consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan, or are not fair and equitable, it shall file an opinion stating its conclusion and the reasons therefor. In such event the Association (in the case of a proposal developed by the Association) or the Secretary (in the case of a proposal developed by the Secretary) may, within 120 days after the filing of such opinion, certify to the special court that the terms and conditions of the proposal have been modified consistent with the opinion of the court and are acceptable to each proposed transferor (other than the Corporation) or transferee, and may petition the special court for reconsideration of the proposal as so modified. After the filing of such petition, the special court shall decide, after a hearing, whether the proposal as modified by the certification is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan and is fair and equitable, and shall enter such further orders as are consistent with its determination.(3) The Corporation is authorized to petition the special court and to be represented regarding any proposed supplemental transaction, contained in a proposal developed by either the Association or the Secretary, whic", "h involves the properties of the Corporation.(4) In proceedings under this subsection, the special court is authorized to exercise the powers of a reorganization court.(5) Any evaluation by the Association, the Secretary, or the Commission shall not be reviewable in any court except the special court in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Congressional findings(a) Congress hereby finds that\u2014(1) the severe operating losses and the deteriorating plant and equipment of the Milwaukee Railroad threaten to cause cessation of its operations in the near future;(2) a cessation of operations by the Milwaukee Railroad would have serious repercussions on", " the economies of the States in which such railroad principally operates (the States of Washington, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);(3) a cessation of operations of the Milwaukee Railroad would result in the loss of many thousands of jobs of railroad workers and other workers whose employment is dependent upon rail service over the lines presently operated by the Milwaukee Railroad;(4) experienced railroad employees make a valuable contribution toward strengthening the railroad industry; and other railroads have the ability and willingness to employ displaced employees of the Milwaukee Railroad;(5) the ownership by employees or by employees and shippers of part or all of the Milwaukee Railroad may be a valuable tool in reorganization and should be given serious consideration;(6) cessation of essential transportation services by the Milwaukee Railroad would endanger the public welfare;(7) cessation of such services is imminent; and(8) there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to meet payroll and other expenses necessary for continuation of services and reorganization of the Milwaukee Railroad.(b) The Congress declares that emergency measures set forth in this chapter must be taken to restructure the Milwaukee Railroad and to avoid the potential unemployment and damage to the economy of the region and of the Nation which a cessation of essential services by the Milwaukee Railroad would otherwise cause.(Pub.

Congressional findings and declarationsThe Congress finds and declares that\u2014(1) the processes set in motion by the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 701(2) current arrangements for the provision of rail freight and commuter service in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States are inadequate to meet the transportation needs of the public and the needs of national security;(3) although the Federal Government has provided billions of dollars in assistance for Conrail and its employees, the Federal interest in ensuring the flow of interstate commerce through rail service in the private sector has not been achieved, and the protection of interstate commerce requires Federal intervention to preserve essential rail service in the private sector;(4) the provisions for protection of employees of bankrupt railroads contained in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 701(5) since holding Conrail liable for employee protection payments would destroy its prospects of becoming a profitable carrier and further injure its employees, an alternative employee protection system must be developed and funded.(Pub.

This equipment is subject to a number of controls under federally established construction and performance standards. Radio equipment is exempt from these regulatory controls, since this equipment continues to be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.Section 2101(2) defines \u201cbarge\u201d as a vessel that is non-self-propelled and that is often pushed ahead, towed alongside, or towed astern on a hawser by a towing vessel. It does not include a vessel that is propelled by sail only.Section 2101(3) defines \u201cboundary line\u201d for the establishment of jurisdictional parameters for various maritime safety laws. Public Law 96\u201332433 U.S.C. 151Section 2101(4) defines \u201cCoast Guard\u201d.Section 2101(5) provides that wherever the term \u201ccommercial service\u201d is used it is to include all vessels except those that are primarily used for combatant purposes. This is to make sure that vessels that are engaged in the transportation of goods or individuals are subject to the applicable maritime and environmental safety laws, even if they are sovereign controlled vessels.Section 2101(6) defines \u201cconsular officer\u201d as one who has authority to issue visas. Traditionally this person is knowledgeable and familiar with the maritime safety and seamen\u2019s welfare laws.Section 2101(7) defines \u201ccrude oil\u201d because certain equipment requirements like inert gas systems, segregated ballast tanks, crude oil washing systems or special ballast arrangements are applicable only to tank vessels that carry ", "crude oil. Crude oil is still included within the definition of \u201chazardous material\u201d and \u201coil\u201d.Section 2101(8) defines a \u201ccrude oil tanker\u201d as one engaged in carrying crude oil. The definition does not include a tank barge since a tanker is defined as a self-propelled tank vessel. See also 2101(38).Section 2101(9) makes it clear that the term \u201cdischarge\u201d when referring to a substance that emanates from a vessel and is related to the marine environmental laws concerning pollution by oil or hazardous substances.Section 2101(10) defines a \u201cdocumented vessel\u201d as any vessel of the United States that has been issued a certificate of documentation that might include a register, enrollment, license, or enrollment and license for various trades.Section 2101(11) lists what is included in the term \u201cfisheries\u201d for the purpose of documentation of vessels and is intended to be all-inclusive of the numerous types of fishing activities.Section 2101(12) defines \u201cforeign vessel\u201d as any foreign flag or foreign operated vessel that is operated under the jurisdiction or authority of a government other than the United States.Section 2101(13) defines a \u201cfreight vessel\u201d as a motor vessel or any vessel propelled by diesel or other internal combustion engines and that carries freight for hire.Section 2101(14) defines \u201chazardous materials\u201d as a broad range of materials that are not only flammable or combustible but are also designated under related maritime safety and environmental laws.Section 2101(15) defines \u201cmarine environment\u201d as an all-inclusive term that was developed to cover land and water areas that could be affected by pollution from all vessels and not only tank vessels.Section 2101(16) defines \u201cmotor vessel\u201d as a vessel propelled by machinery other than steam to make it clear that these vessels are not steam vessels.Section 2101(17) defines \u201cnautical school vessel\u201d as a vessel that can be a privately owned and operated as well as a publicly owned and operated school vessel.Section 2101(18) defines \u201coceanographic research vesse", "l\u201d as a vessel employed in oceanography or limnology research or instruction. It is defined because this type of vessel, while not inspected and certified as such, is subject to a number of special statutory and regulatory requirements.Section 2101(19) defines \u201coffshore supply vessel\u201d as a class of vessel that is limited by tonnage and its employment in the mineral and oil industry and while so employed it is not a small passenger vessel.Section 2101(20) defines \u201coil\u201d to include oil of any type, in any form, or in any mixture. This is the definition that originated with marine environment and pollution laws and continues the definition that was adopted by port and tanker safety laws.Section 2101(21) defines the term \u201cpassengers\u201d in relation to various types of vessels. Due to the complexity of existing laws with respect to the definitions of \u201cpassenger\u201d on various categories of vessels and the need to not make any changes of a substantive nature that could be construed as controversial, four definitions of \u201cpassenger\u201d have been included.Section 2101(22) defines \u201cpassenger vessel\u201d as one that is at least 100 gross tons and carries at least one passenger for hire.Section 2101(23) defines \u201cproduct carrier\u201d as a tanker that is engaged in carrying oil. This definition when read with the definition of tanker means that it is a self-propelled vessel. A tank barge carrying oil products is a tank vessel but is not subject to the special standards or requirements for a product carrier.Section 2101(24) defines a \u201cpublic vessel\u201d as a governmental vessel that is not in commercial service.

This definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102 that relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement programs.Section 2101(37) defines a \u201csteam vessel\u201d as a vessel propelled by steam. However, steam vessels of not more than 40 feet that are used exclusively for pleasure are not included.Section 2101(38) defines \u201ctanker\u201d as a self-propelled tank vessel that has been constructed or primarily adapted to carry oil or hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces. This vessel is a subclass of tank vessel, which is defined in section 2101(39). This subclass definition is necessary because certain statutory minimum requirements that are consi", "stent with internationally accepted standards are solely applicable to these vessels.Section 2101(39) defines a \u201ctank vessel\u201d as a vessel carrying oil or hazardous materials in bulk or residue including a tanker as defined in section 2101(38).Section 2101(40) defines \u201ctowing vessel\u201d as a vessel in commercial service that pushes, pulls, or tows alongside and includes what is traditionally known as a tug.Section 2101(41) defines \u201cundocumented\u201d which, in part, facilitates the classification of vessels that may be numbered by the proper issuing authority in a State.Section 2101(42) defines an \u201cuninspected passenger vessel\u201d as a vessel carrying six or less passengers.Section 2101(43) defines an \u201cuninspected vessel\u201d as a vessel not subject to inspection and certification by the Coast Guard under section 3301. Recreational vessels and inland towing vessels are typical uninspected vessels.Section 2101(44) defines \u201cUnited States\u201d to establish geographical boundaries for the applicability of the various maritime safety and environmental safety laws of this subtitle. This definition is further limited by definitions in section 2102 that relate to recreational boating safety and facility improvement programs.Section 2101(45) makes it clear that \u201cvessel\u201d as used in this subtitle has the same meaning as is provided in section 3 of title 1Section 2101(46) defines \u201cvessel of the United States\u201d as a vessel that is documented or numbered under the laws of the United States. A documented vessel and those vessels that are numbered by a State or Federal authority are afforded the protection of the laws of the United States.Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextSection 1 of title 14section 101 of title 14Pub.

Some changes were made to increase some antiquated and inadequate penalties.The assessment of civil penalties under this section should not require an \u201con the record\u201d hearing within the meaning of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). It is intended that these civil penalties be assessed in a fair manner. However, the Committee recognizes that statutes passed in the last decade have involved the Coast Guard in tens of thousands of civil penalty enforcement cases and that it is necessary that the penalties be assessed efficiently. The Coast Guard\u2019s procedural regulations for assessing civil penalties ensure that the essential elements of due process, notice, and opportunity to be heard, are provided to alleged violators (see 33 CFR Subpart 1.07). The more rigid and time-consuming procedures applicable to APA adjudications are unwarranted in the case of Coast Guard civil penalty assessment procedures and would seriously hamper the orderly enforcement of these administrative penalties.Editorial NotesAmendments2006\u2014Pub.

This section represents one of the sought-after advantages of the bill to simplify access to the provisions of law governing the regulation of vessels. Under the present law, a vessel\u2019s inspection status must be determined by examining a table appearing at section 2.01\u20137A of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations that divides all vessels into more than 70 separate classes.It is important to note that while the classes of vessels are now limited to ten, there is no prohibition against developing regulations to meet the special needs of various size vessels within any one category. For example, it is expected that the Coast Guard will continue the practice of establishing standards for freight vessels of not more than 100 gross tons and other standards for larger freight vessels.It should also be noted that a particular vessel can, when engaged in various types of operations, be subject to varying inspection laws. For example, an offshore supply vessel could be classed as a small passenger vessel or a passenger vessel when it operat", "es as a crew boat carrying individuals other than those defined in section 2101(21). If the offshore supply vessel is 500 gross tons and over it would then be subject to inspection as a seagoing motor vessel, a freight vessel, or a passenger vessel.Editorial NotesAmendments2004\u2014Par.

For example, a vessel inspected and certified as a small passenger vessel would, when carrying oil or hazardous materials in bulk as cargo or cargo residue, also have to be inspected as a tank vessel. It makes it clear that a vessel excluded by section 3302 from the requirements of inspection in any one of the ten categories is not necessarily excluded from inspection as a vessel in another category.

Briefly stated, a classification society, like the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), establishes and administers standards for the design, construction, and periodic survey of commercial vessels, yachts, and other marine structures. Classification certifies adherence to these standards, thus representing that a vessel or structure possesses the structural and mechanical fitness required for its intended service.The section requires that a Federal department, agency, or instrumentality recognize the American Bureau of Shipping as its agent for classing vessels owned by the Federal Government and in any matters related to classification. In effect, the ABS has a statutory monopoly on classing vessels of the United States Government. Additionally, the section contains the authority to permit the Secretary to rely on reports, documents, and certificates issued by a classification society that is similar to the American Bureau of Shipping. However, a \u201csimilar classification society\u201d continues to mean one that is organized like the American Bureau of Shipping with attendant gov", "ernmental representation.Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextThe date of the enactment of the Howard Coble Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014, referred to in subsec.

L. 111\u2013207, \u00a7\u202f2July 27, 2010124 Stat. 2243\n\u201cThe Congress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) There are approximately 200 overnight ocean-going cruise vessels worldwide. The average ocean-going cruise vessel carries 2,000 passengers with a crew of 950 people.\u201c(2) In 2007 alone, approximately 12,000,000 passengers were projected to take a cruise worldwide.\u201c(3) Passengers on cruise vessels have an inadequate appreciation of their potential vulnerability to crime while on ocean voyages, and those who may be victimized lack the information they need to understand their legal rights or to know whom to contact for help in the immediate aftermath of the crime.\u201c(4) Sexual violence, the disappearance of passengers from vessels on the high seas, and other serious crimes have occurred during luxury cruises.\u201c(5) Over the last 5 years, sexual assault and physical assaults on cruise vessels were the leading crimes investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with regard to cruise vessel incidents.\u201c(6) These crimes at sea can involve attacks both by passengers and crewmembers on other passengers and crewmembers.\u201c(7) Except for Unite", "d States flagged vessels, or foreign flagged vessels operating in an area subject to the direct jurisdiction of the United States, there are no Federal statutes or regulations that explicitly require cruise lines to report alleged crimes to United States Government officials.\u201c(8) It is not known precisely how often crimes occur on cruise vessels or exactly how many people have disappeared during ocean voyages because cruise line companies do not make comprehensive, crime-related data readily available to the public.\u201c(9) Obtaining reliable crime-related cruise data from governmental sources can be difficult, because multiple countries may be involved when a crime occurs on the high seas, including the flag country for the vessel, the country of citizenship of particular passengers, and any countries having special or maritime jurisdiction.\u201c(10) It can be difficult for professional crime investigators to immediately secure an alleged crime scene on a cruise vessel, recover evidence of an onboard offense, and identify or interview potential witnesses to the alleged crime.\u201c(11) Most cruise vessels that operate into and out of United States ports are registered under the laws of another country, and investigations and prosecutions of crimes against passengers and crewmembers may involve the laws and authorities of multiple nations.\u201c(12) The Department of Homeland Security has found it necessary to establish 500-yard security zones around cruise vessels to limit the risk of terrorist attack. Recently piracy has dramatically increased throughout the world.\u201c(13) To enhance the safety of cruise passengers, the owners of cruise vessels could upgrade, modernize, and retrofit the safety and security infrastructure on such vessels by installing peep holes in passenger room doors, installing security video cameras in targeted areas, limiting access to passenger rooms to select staff during specific times, and installing acoustic hailing and warning devices capable of communicating over distances.\u201d \u00a7\u202f3508. Crime scene preservat", "ion training for passenger vessel crewmembers(a) In GeneralThe Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Maritime Administration, shall maintain training standards and curricula to allow for the certification of passenger vessel security personnel, crewmembers, and law enforcement officials on the appropriate methods for prevention, detection, evidence preservation, and reporting of criminal activities in the international maritime environment. The Administrator of the Maritime Administration may certify organizations in the United States and abroad that offer the curriculum for training and certification under subsection (c).(b) Minimum StandardsThe standards established by the Secretary under subsection (a) shall include\u2014(1) the training and certification of vessel security personnel, crewmembers, and law enforcement officials in accordance with accepted law enforcement and security guidelines, policies, and procedures, including recommendations for incorporating a background check process for personnel trained and certified in foreign ports;(2) the training of students and instructors in all aspects of prevention, detection, evidence preservation, and reporting of criminal activities in the international maritime environment; and(3) the provision or recognition of off-site training and certification courses in the United States and foreign countries to develop and provide the required training and certification described in subsection (a) and to enhance security awareness and security practices related to the preservation of evidence in response to crimes on board passenger vessels.(c) Certification RequirementNo vessel to which this section applies may enter a United States port on a voyage (or voyage segment) on which a United States citizen is a passenger unless there is at least 1 crewmember onboard who is certified as having successfully completed training in the prevention, detection, evidence preservation, and reporting of criminal activities in the inte", "rnational maritime environment on passenger vessels under subsection (a).(d) Civil PenaltyAny person that violates this section or a regulation under this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $50,000.(e) Denial of EntryThe Secretary may deny entry into the United States to a vessel to which this section applies if the owner of the vessel\u2014(1) commits an act or omission for which a penalty may be imposed under subsection (d); or(2) fails to pay a penalty imposed on the owner under subsection (d).(Added Pub.

The Committee contemplates that United States vessels will be issued a 2 year certificate of inspection with a mid-period examination. The Committee also co", "ntemplates that foreign-flag vessels will continue to be tracked and boarded at least once a year or when they first arrive in the United States. The Secretary may examine the foreign-flag tank vessel but may accept, as a basis for the issuance of a certificate of compliance, in whole or in part a foreign-issued certificate.Each vessel over 10 years of age must undergo a special and detailed inspection of structural strength and hull integrity, as specified by the Secretary. An inspection or examination may be conducted by any officer authorized by the Secretary. The Committee expects that, whenever possible, a qualified marine inspector will be used wherever the vessel undergoes these 10-year inspections. The Secretary may also contract for inspections or examinations in the United States and in foreign countries.The primary reason for including a provision that permits the contracting for the conduct of inspections and examinations is to provide flexibility in foreign areas where Coast Guard marine inspectors are not normally available.A contract inspector may be authorized to act on behalf of the Secretary, but may not issue a certificate of inspection or compliance.

They are as follows:Clause (1) regarding \u201ca vessel of the United States\u201d includes all vessels documented under Chapter 121 of title 46 or numbered under Chapter 123 of title 46.Clause (2) regarding \u201ca vessel on the navigable waters of the United States\u201d includes all domestic or foreign vessels found in or on the navigable waters of the United States.Clause (3) regarding \u201ca vessel owned by a citizen of the United States or a corporation established by or under the laws of the United States or a State, and not registered in a foreign country\u201d includes all vessels owned by citizens of the United States (as defined in 5107(7)) [sic] and not registered under the laws of a foreign country, wherever the vessels may be located.Clause (4) regarding \u201ca public vessel of the United States\u201d includes all United States public vessels.Clause (5) regarding \u201ca vessel otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d includes foreign vessels that are subject to United States jurisdiction as a result of bilateral agreements, licenses, customary international law or other means, including those using deepwater port or outer continental shelf or EEZ facili", "ties located in areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.Section 5102(b) lists the specific exemptions from load line requirements. The specific exemptions may be grouped as follows:(a) Vessel type (ships of war, pleasure vessels, fishing vessels, small passenger vessels on domestic voyages);(b) Area of operation (rivers, harbors, bays, sounds, etc.);(c) Minimum size (length); and(d) Treaty exclusions.Clause (1) exempts vessels of war from load line requirements.Clause (2) exempts recreational vessels operated only for pleasure from load line requirements.Clause (3) exempts fishing vessels from load line requirements.Clauses (4) and (5) exempt certain existing fish processing and fish tender vessels not on a foreign voyage from load line requirements. The exception is limited to those vessels not on international voyages to ensure compliance with United States obligations under the International Load Line Convention.Clause (6) exempts from load line requirements all U.S. vessels operating on domestic voyages within the Boundary Line, as defined in section 2101 of this titleClause (7) exempts all vessels that are less than 24 meters (79 feet) in length from load line requirements whether on international or domestic voyages.Clause (8) exempts from load line requirements those public vessels that are on domestic voyages.Clause (9) exempts from load line requirements those vessels which have been excluded from the requirements \u201cby specific action of a treaty of the United States.\u201d The only current treaty which excludes vessels from load line requirements is the Convention Between the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada Concerning Load Lines (49 Stat. 2685August 11, 1934Clause (10) exempts from load line requirements existing U.S. vessels that are under 150 gross tons while engaged on a domestic voyage. This is a grandfather provision, continuing the existing exemption for these vessels. Vessels built after January 1, 1986Clause (11) exempts small passenger vessels engaged on domestic vo", "yages from load line requirements. Small passenger vessels are inspected under Subchapter T of Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Under Subchapter T, the Coast Guard regulates these vessels with regard to safety; the requirements are based on the number of passengers, length, and gross tonnage of the vessel. Safety-related requirements in Subchapter T regulations include hull structure and watertightness, stability, weathertight integrity, and safe movement of persons on deck, the principal safety features covered by load line regulations. This specific exemption from load line requirements for small passenger vessels is consistent with existing law and does not alter in any way the Coast Guard\u2019s authority to regulate small passenger vessels under Subchapter T.Clause (12) exempts vessels of the working voyages from the requirement to have load lines.Section 5102(c) authorizes the Secretary to assign load lines for any vessel exempted from load line requirements by subsection (b) upon the request of the owner. It also provides that any exempted vessel for which load lines are assigned will remain subject to the load line requirements until its load line certificate is surrendered and the load line marks are removed.Section 5102(d) provides that this chapter shall not be construed as abrogating the provisions of other treaties and conventions to which the United States is a party, which are not in conflict with the International Convention on Load Lines.Editorial NotesAmendments2016\u2014Subsec.

The Secretary may reduce the percentage if the Secretary decides on investigation that United States seamen are not available. This investigation and percentage reduction authority is the sole responsibility of the Secretary of Transportation and accordingly the Secretary is to make these decisions expeditiously, promptly, and independently so as not to be dependent on any other agency to make this reduction. The Committee believes the Secretary is capable of this decision and need not delay or fail to make the decision because some other agency does not have the information or would require an extended period to acquire that information. The phrase \u201cfor any reason\u201d is used merely to emphasize the complete discretion of the Secretary in making this decision. In addition, because this decision is based on an investigation, formal procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply.Subsections (c) and (d) provide that a vessel, except a passenger vessel, on departure from the United States that has been granted a construction or operating differential subsidy have a higher percentage citizenship requirement. Subsection (c) requires all of the crew and employees of a cargo vessel be United States citizens. Subsection (d) requires at least 90 percent of the entire complement of a passenger vessel be United States citizens. The phrase \u201cincluding all licensed individuals\u201d emphasizes that all licensed individuals are required to be United States citizens as required by subsection (a) and that they compose part of the 90 percent requirement under this subsection. Further, under subsection (d), the balance of the complement must be individuals who have a declaration of intention to become a United States citizen or evidence of admission to the United States as a permanent resident and may only be empl", "oyed in the steward\u2019s department of the passenger vessel.Except for the master, subsection (e) permits a non-United States citizen to fill a vacancy that occurs for any reason on a United States documented vessel during a foreign voyage until the vessel returns to a United States port where a United States citizen replacement can be obtained. The phrase \u201cfor any reason\u201d is used merely for emphasis.Subsection (f) provides for the penalty for violation of this section.Subsection (g) requires a deck or engineer officer on a vessel that has been granted an operating differential subsidy or is under the control by the Department of Transportation to be, if eligible, a member of the Naval Reserve.

The information is available under section 12503 for use by the public, similarly under the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920.Subsection (b) lists the vessel identification information which is required to be maintained by the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to prescribe other information to be maintained in addition to the items listed. For example, the Secretary may identify vessels issued fisheries permits by the Department of Commerce. The Secretary may also monitor transactions involving vessels that require approval by the Secretary under section 9 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 App. U.S.C. 808) before interest or control in the vessel may be transferred to a noncitizen.Subsection (c) clarifies that the Secretary has the flexibility to maintain this system in connection with any other information system maintained by the Secretary, including the Federal Aviation Administration system containing aircraft ownership information.

For vessels that have obtained a regulatory tonnage measurement under this section, the Secretary is required to use the regulatory tonnage measurement to determine the application of those laws listed in section 14305(a) and those not listed by the Secre", "tary by regulation, as provided in section 14302(c). It is the intent of the Committee to list in section 14305(a) certain U.S. tonnage-based laws that would impose increased regulatory burdens on industry if the Convention measurement were used for applicability determinations.Clause (1) of section 14305(a) includes the following parts of subtitle II of title 46, U.S.C.:Part A: General provisions (including definitions.)Part B: Inspection and Regulation of Vessels.Part C: Load Lines, which is enacted as part of this legislation. Although most load line requirements are based on vessel length, and not tonnage, a few requirements are based on tonnage. (It is only the tonnage based requirements to which this provision applies.)Part E: Licenses, Certificates, and Merchant Mariners\u2019 Documents.Part F: Manning of Vessels.Part G: Merchant Seamen Protection and Relief.Part H: Sections 12106(c) and 12108(c) only\u2014Identification of Vessels.The other U.S. laws listed in clause (2) through (10) of this section are self-explanatory. Clause (10) refers to domestic law as well as the Officers\u2019 Competency Certificates Convention, 1936.In addition, three other international conventions are listed in clauses (11) through (13): (1) the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, (2) the Convention on the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, and (3) the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The International Maritime Organization has established interim schemes which address the use of the Convention tonnage measurement system as a basis for the applicability of these three conventions. The applicable sections of those schemes are the following:The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea: IMCO Resolution A.494 (XII) of November 19, 1981\u201c(a) In respect of the requirements of Regulation 3 of Chapter IV of the 1974 SOLAS Convention for ships the keels of which are laid before 18 July 1994, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme, in which case the above-m", "entioned entry should be made in the Radio-telephony Certificate only; and\u201c(b) In respect of the regulations for cargo ships of less than 1,600 tons gross tonnage (as measured under national systems), the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18 July 1984.\u201dThe International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978: IMO Resolution A.540 (XIII) of November 17, 1983The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973: IMO Resolution A.541 (XIII) of November 17, 1983At the request of a shipowner, the Administration may allow a ship of less than 400 tons gross tonnage (measured under the previous national tonnage rules) the keel of which is laid on or before 31 December 1985 and which is required to be measured under the provisions of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969, to use the gross tonnage measured under the national tonnage rules which were in effect prior to the coming into force of the 1969 Tonnage Convention, for the purpose of application of the provisions of MARPOL 73/78. Such tonnage, however, shall not be shown on the 1969 Tonnage Certificate.It further provides that \u201cthe interim scheme shall not apply to ships the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, except that in respect of regulations for ships of less than 400 tons gross tonnage (as measured under previous national rules), the keels of which are laid after 31 December 1985, the Administration may continue to apply the interim scheme until 18 July 1994.\u201dClause (14) provides that the regulatory measurement system may be used to determine which vessels must demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility (when such a demonstration is required by law). If it is determined that a vessel must show evidence of financial responsibility, the lim", "its of financial responsibility are determined using the vessel\u2019s Convention measurement.Clause (15) provides that the regulatory measurement system may be used for the application of laws not identified by the Secretary under section 14302(c).Section 14305(b) provides that if a vessel is measured under the regulatory tonnage measurement system for the application of one law listed in subsection (a), it must be measured under that system for the application of all laws listed in subsection (a).Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextSection 4 of the Bridge to Bridge Radiotelephone Act (33 U.S.C. 1203(a)section 1203(a) of Title 33Section 4(a)(3) of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (33 U.S.C. 1223(a)(3)section 4(a)(3) of Pub.

As in all codifications, the term \u201cincludes\u201d means \u201cincludes but is not limited to\u201d and, therefore, is not intended to be an exclusive listing of those items that a court has determined or may determine as falling within the meaning of the term \u201cother necessar", "ies\u201d as contained in current law. The definition is new, is based on 46 App. U.S.C. 971\u2013974, and makes no substantive change to law.Section 31301(5) defines \u201cpreferred maritime lien\u201d to mean a lien on a vessel that arises before a preferred mortgage was filed under section 31321 of this titleSection 31301(6)(A) defines \u201cpreferred mortgage\u201d to mean a mortgage that meets the requirements of section 31322. This clause makes no substantive change to law.Section 31301(6)(B) defines \u201cpreferred mortgage\u201d to also mean a mortgage on a documented foreign vessel that is preferred under sections 31325 and 31326 for purposes of enforcement of the outstanding mortgage indebtedness. Preference is only granted if the mortgage is executed under the laws of a foreign country, registered under those laws in a public register at the port of registry or at a central office. The use of the word \u201cestablished\u201d in place of \u201ccreated\u201d in the current law or \u201ceffective\u201d as used in the treaties is not intended to make any substantive change to law. The only substantive changes to law made by this clause are the elimination of the exemption of foreign vessels of less than 200 gross tons, and clarification of the rule of interpretation that if a vessel is registered in one country, but is permitted to fly temporarily the flag of another country (such as through a demise charter), it is the law of the country in which the ownership of the vessel is documented that is used to determine when a mortgage attains preferred status.Editorial NotesAmendments2010\u2014Par.

This subsection makes substantive changes to law. The bill would allow a bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related instrument to be filed at the same time an application for documentation under chapter 121 is filed. The Committee intends that the types of related instruments required to be filed be defined by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation. A major change the bill makes is that the instrument needs only be filed with the Secretary of Transportation to be valid. It is not necessary that it be recorded. This change is being made to eliminate a problem under existing law that prevents a person from recording an instrument when the vessel has not bee", "n yet documented. When filed with the Secretary, it is valid (to the extent the vessel is involved) against any person except the grantor, mortgagor, or assignor, their heirs or devisees, and a person having actual notice of that instrument. Clauses (A)\u2013(C) make no substantive change to law.Paragraph (2) provides that each bill of sale, conveyance, mortgage, assignment, or related instrument that is filed in substantial compliance with the requirements of this section is valid against any person from the time it is filed with the Secretary.Paragraph (3) provides that it is the responsibility of the parties to an instrument to use diligence to ensure that the particulars of a filed instrument for which they are responsible are in substantial compliance. It is not the responsibility of the Secretary to validate the information in the instrument. If an instrument is later found to be invalid because it is not in substantial compliance, and the parties lose the benefits of a preferred mortgage, it is their fault, not the Secretary\u2019s.Section 31321(b) sets out the requirements that an instrument must meet to be properly filed. To be filed the instruments must: (1) identify the vessel; (2) state the name and address of each party to the instrument; (3) state, if a mortgage, the amount of the direct or contingent obligations (in one or more units of account as agreed to by the parties) that is or may become secured by the mortgage, excluding interest, expenses, and fees; (4) state the interest of the grantor, mortgagor, or assignor; (5) state the interest sold, conveyed, mortgaged, or assigned; and (6) be signed and acknowledged. While most of these items are required under current law to be included in the index, and therefore required to be submitted to the Secretary to be recorded, this subsection makes a number of substantive changes to law. First, while vessel names are currently required to be submitted, this requirement has been broadened so that hull identification numbers and official numbers can be used to more", " specifically identify a vessel (since many vessels have the same name). Second, it requires the mortgage to state the maximum amount of the obligation, including principal, interest, fees, etc., that are secured by the mortgage. It also clarifies that the mortgage obligation may be payable in more than one unit of account, such as yen, franc, or special drawing right. Third, it recognizes that under some modern financing practices an instrument may not have a date of maturity. The requirement for supplying the date of maturity has been eliminated.Section 31321(c) provides that if an instrument filed involves a vessel that has not yet been documented, and the Secretary decides that the vessel cannot be documented by the applicant, then the Secretary shall send notice of that denial to the parties, including the reasons for the Secretary\u2019s decision. If the parties have not corrected the deficiencies within 90 days, the Secretary may terminate the filing and return the instruments. This invalidates the instruments.Section 31321(d) prohibits a person from withdrawing an application for documentation of a vessel for which a mortgage has been filed unless the mortgagee consents. Since the withdrawal will invalidate the mortgage, the mortgagee should be allowed to prohibit the withdrawal.Section 31321(e) makes a substantive change to law. It requires the Secretary to record instruments in the order they are received for filing, not in the order in which they were received for recording. It also makes a substantive change by eliminating the specific indexes required under the law and substituting a general requirement for the Secretary to maintain indexes of instruments filed or recorded, or both, for use by the public. These indexes, prescribed by regulations, must be in keeping with U.S. obligations under treaties to which the United States is a party. Since section 104 [105] of this Act makes the existing rules and regulations applicable under this subsection, the current indexing system will be maintained that inclu", "des the names of the vessels; names of the parties to the instruments; time and date each instrument was received; the interest in the vessel that was sold, conveyed, mortgaged, or assigned; and the date of the maturity of the mortgage, if any. However, it allows the Secretary by regulation to automate the system with computers, as long as the new system provides the public with an adequate method of finding and examining these public records.Section 31321(f) makes a substantive change to law by eliminating the requirement that a partial discharge of indebtedness be filed with the Secretary. The bill requires that on the full and final discharge of indebtedness the mortgagee, on request of the Secretary or mortgagor, shall provide the Secretary with a written, acknowledged certificate of discharge of the indebtedness. This subsection also makes a substantive change by requiring that the mortgagee, not the mortgagor, provide the certificate of discharge. The Secretary shall then record the certificate. However, this does not prohibit a person from submitting a certificate of discharge under subsection (a) since it is a related instrument. This subsection also makes a substantive change to law by eliminating the requirement that the discharge be endorsed on the vessel\u2019s certificate of documentation, and that the Customs Service only may clear a vessel after an endorsement has been made. This change is made because of the elimination of endorsements under section 31322.house floor statementSection 31321 has been changed to clarify that a mortgage, whenever made, must be filed to be valid against third parties. This clarification allows mortgage closings to occur previous to filing of an instrument, and to eliminate the need for a fictional simultaneous closing and filing.Subsection (g) clarifies that if an application for documentation is filed for a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage under section 31322(d) (as enacted by this Act), the preferred mortgage must be filed with the Secretary at the same time the app", "lication for documentation is filed to be valid against third parties. If the preferred mortgage is filed with the Secretary at the time the documentation application is filed, it is valid from the time it became a preferred mortgage under section 31322(d).When a State preferred mortgage under section 31322(d) is finally discharged, subsection (h) of this section requires the mortgagee to provide upon request to the Secretary or a State, whichever is more appropriate, an acknowledged certificate of discharge of indebtedness. This is necessary when a vessel in the system moves from a participating titling State and is not retitled in another participating State. In this case, there is no way to update the status of the indebtedness through the original titling State. The Secretary is required to accept this information to be maintained in the vessel identification system under section 12503(c) of title 46Editorial NotesAmendments2010\u2014Subsec. (a)(1). Pub.

While a preferred mortgage must still include the whole of a vessel, this subsection eliminates the exception of certain vessels under 25 gross tons. It allows a vessel for which an application for documentation has been filed to have a preferred mortgage. It allows a mortgage to be a preferred mortgage from the time all four conditions are met, rather than from when the vessel is finally documented. Therefore, a mortgage will usually attain its preferred status when the application for documentation and the instrument have been filed. This subsection changes the requirement that all documented vessels have as a mortgagee a person that is a citizen of the United States, as defined in section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, and allows a State, the United States Government, a federally insured depository institution, or any other person approved by the Secretary to be a mortgagee.Subsection (a)(2) makes a substantive change to law exempting fishing, fish processing, and fish tender vessels, and vessels operated only for pleasure from the mortgagee restrictions, since these vessels do not have significant national defense use.Subsection (b) permits a preferred mortgage to have any rate of interest that is agreeable to the parties to the mortgage. This subsection makes no substantive change to law.Subsection (c)(1) applies to a mortgage that covers more than one vessel or additional property that is not a vessel. This subsection allows a preferred mortgage to include a separate discharge of the a", "dditional vessels and property.Subsection (c)(2) applies when a preferred mortgage covers more than one vessel, does not provide for the separate discharge of a vessel, and is to be sold by court order. The amount of the mortgage indebtedness attributable to a vessel is that part of the indebtedness, increased by 20 percent, that the court determines approximates the value that the particular vessel bears to the value of all the vessels and property covered by the mortgage. In other words, the amount to be set by the court is the estimated value of the one vessel plus 20 percent of that value to assure sufficiency of collateral.This section also makes a substantive change by eliminating the requirement that a vessel\u2019s certificate of documentation be endorsed with information from the mortgage. This change is made since most of the information is out of date when examined, and since a mortgage must be carried on self-propelled vessels under section 31324(b). This section also eliminates the requirement for the inclusion of an affidavit of good faith. However, both criminal and civil penalties have been added [in section 31330] to help ensure that there is not fraud. This section also eliminates the requirement that a preferred mortgage include a separate discharge for additional property that is not a vessel, the requirement that the mortgage does not stipulate that the mortgagee waives the mortgage\u2019s preferred status; and the requirement for clearing vessels with endorsed documents through Customs.house floor statementUnder section 31322(a)(2) a \u201cvessel operated only for pleasure\u201d is exempt from any restrictions on who can be a mortgagee. This standard is the same as used for the documentation of a recreational vessel under section 12109 of title 46Under subsection (c)(2), if a vessel covered by a preferred mortgage that includes more than one vessel or property that is not a vessel is to be sold on the order of a district court in remUnder subsection (d) of section 31322, a mortgage or other instrument represent", "ing financing of a vessel under State law that is made under applicable State law and covers the whole of a vessel titled in a State is deemed to be a preferred mortgage if two conditions are fulfilled. The first condition is that the Secretary must certify that the State in which the vessel is titled has a titling system that complies with the Secretary\u2019s vessel titling guidelines established under section 13106(b)(8) of title 46Public Law 99\u2013626Paragraph (2) of subsection (d) clarifies that mortgages or other financing instruments may obtain preferred status under subsection (d) if they cover vessels titled in a State after the Secretary certifies the compliance of the State\u2019s titling system, and the State begins making vessel identification information available to the Secretary. Preferred mortgage status can only be attained when these two conditions are in effect. Mortgages or financing instruments made prior to that are not preferred and, if these two conditions cease to exist, new mortgages or forecasting instruments made after that time cannot attain preferred status.The law of the titling State controls the making of the preferred mortgage or financing instrument under this subsection. No additional Federal recording requirements may be imposed for the mortgage or instrument to obtain preferred status under this subsection.Paragraph (3) of this subsection ensures that a preferred mortgage under this subsection retains that status if the vessel covered by the mortgage later relinquishes its title. If the vessel is subsequently documented, the continuing validity of the mortgage is determined by section 31321(g) (as enacted by this Act).Subsection (e) of section 31322 clarifies the validity of preferred mortgages made under subsection (d). In the case of a State titled vessel covered by a preferred mortgage for which a new titling application is filed, the validity of the mortgage is governed by the law of the titling State in which the mortgage became preferred. In the case of a documented vessel covered ", "by a preferred mortgage for which an application for a State title is filed, or a State titled vessel covered by a preferred mortgage for which an application for documentation is filed, the validity of the preferred mortgage is governed by section 31322(a) of title 46Information on vessels with preferred mortgages made under State law will be available to creditors from the vessel identification system under chapter 125 of title 46 (as enacted by this Act).Editorial NotesAmendments2018\u2014Subsec.
