Tied Aid Credit Fund and program(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) tied aid and partially untied aid credits offered by other countries are a predatory method of financing exports because of their market-distorting effects;(2) these distortions have caused the United States to lose export sales, with resulting losses in economic growth and employment;(3) these practices undermine market mechanisms that would otherwise result in export purchase decisions made on the basis of price, quality, delivery, and other factors directly related to the export, where official financing is not subsidized and would be a neutral factor in the transaction;(4) support of commercial exports by donor countries with tied aid and p", "artially untied aid credits impedes the growth of developing countries because it diverts development assistance funds from essential developmental purposes;(5) the Bank has, at a minimum, the following two tasks\u2014(A)(i) first, the Bank should match foreign export credit agencies and aid agencies when they engage in tied aid outside the confines of the Arrangement and when they exploit loopholes, such as untied aid;(ii) such matching is needed to provide the United States with leverage in efforts at the OECD to reduce the overall level of export subsidies;(iii) only through matching foreign export credit offers can the Bank buttress United States negotiators in their efforts to bring these loopholes within the disciplines of the Arrangement; and(iv) in order to bring untied aid within the discipline of the Arrangement, the Bank should consider initiating highly competitive financial support when the Bank learns that foreign untied aid offers will be made; and(B) second, the Bank should support United States exporters when the exporters face foreign competition that is consistent with the Arrangement and the Subsidies Code of the World Trade Organization, but which places United States exporters at a competitive disadvantage; and(6) there should be established in the Bank a tied aid program to target the export markets of those countries, including those that are not a party to the Arrangement, which make extensive use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits, or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid, for commercial advantage for the purposes of\u2014(A) enforcing compliance with the existing Arrangement restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits for commercial purposes; and(B) facilitating efforts to negotiate, establish, and enforce new or revised comprehensive international arrangements effectively restricting the use of tied aid and partially untied aid credits, or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid, for commercial purposes; and(C) promoting complia", "nce with Arrangement rules among foreign export credit agencies that are not a party to the Arrangement;and such program should be used aggressively for such purposes.(b) Establishment of tied aid credit program(1) In generalThe Bank shall establish a tied aid credit program under which grants shall be made from funds available in the Tied Aid Credit Fund established under subsection (c)\u2014(A) to supplement the financing of a United States export when there is a reasonable expectation that predatory financing will be provided by another country for a sale by a competitor of the United States exporter with respect to such export and with special attention to matching tied aid and partially untied aid credits extended by other governments\u2014(i) in violation of the Arrangement; or(ii) in cases in which the Bank determines that United States trade or economic interests justify the matching of tied aid credits extended in compliance with the Arrangement, including grandfathered cases;(B) to supplement the financing of United States exports to foreign markets which are actual or potential export markets for any country which the Bank determines\u2014(i) engages in predatory official export financing through the use of tied aid or partially untied aid credits, and impedes negotiations or violates agreements on tied aid to eliminate the use of such credits for commercial purposes; or(ii) engages in predatory financing practices that seek to circumvent international agreements on tied aid; or(C) to supplement the financing of United States exports under such other circumstances as the Bank may determine to be appropriate for carrying out the purposes of this section.(2) Administration of programThe tied aid credit program shall be administered by the Bank\u2014(A) in consultation with the Secretary and in accordance with the principles, process, and standards developed pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection and the purposes described in subsection (a)(5);(B) in cooperation with United States exporters and private financial instit", "utions or entities, and in consultation with other Federal agencies, as appropriate; and(C) in consultation with the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies.(3) Coordination with other export financingUnder the tied aid credit program, the Bank may combine grants from the Tied Aid Credit Fund with\u2014(A) any guarantee, insurance, or other extension of credit provided by the Bank under this subchapter;(B) any export financing provided by any private financial institution or other entity; and(C) any other type of export financing,in such manner and under such terms as the Bank determines to be appropriate, including combinations of export financing in the form of blended financing and parallel financing.(4) Information on countries which engage in official predatory export financing and impede negotiationsIn order to assist the Bank to make the most efficient use of funds available for supplemental financing under paragraph (1)(B), the United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce may provide information on principal sectors and key markets of countries described in paragraph (1)(B) to the Bank, the Secretary, and the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies. The Bank shall also request and take into consideration the views of the private sector on principal sectors and key markets of countries described in paragraph (1)(B).(5) Principles, process, and standards governing use of the Fund(A) In generalThe Secretary and the Bank jointly shall develop a process for, and the principles and standards to be used in, determining how the amounts in the Tied Aid Credit Fund could be used most effectively and efficiently to carry out the purposes of subsection (a)(6).(B) Content of principles, process, and standards(i) Consideration of certain principles and standardsIn developing the principles and standards referred to in subparagraph (A), the Secretary and the Bank shall consider administering the Tied Aid Credit Fund in accordance with t", "he following principles and standards:(I) The Tied Aid Credit Fund should be used to leverage multilateral negotiations to restrict the scope for aid-financed trade distortions through new multilateral rules, to police existing rules, and to seek compliance by those countries that are not a party to the Arrangement.(II) The Tied Aid Credit Fund will be used to counter a foreign tied aid credit confronted by a United States exporter when bidding for a capital project.(III) Credible information about an offer of foreign tied aid will be required before the Tied Aid Credit Fund is used to offer specific terms to match such an offer. In cases where information about a specific offer of foreign tied aid (or untied aid used to promote exports as if it were tied aid) is not available in a timely manner, or is unavailable because the foreign export credit agency involved is not subject to the reporting requirements under the Arrangement, then the Bank may decide to use the Tied Aid Credit Fund based on credible evidence of a history of such offers under similar circumstances or other forms of credible evidence.(IV) The Tied Aid Credit Fund will be used to enable a competitive United States exporter to pursue further market opportunities on commercial terms made possible by the use of the Fund.(V) Each use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund will be in accordance with the Arrangement unless a breach of the Arrangement has been committed by a foreign export credit agency.(VI) The Tied Aid Credit Fund may only be used to defend potential sales by United States companies to a project that is environmentally sound.(VII) The Tied Aid Credit Fund may be used to preemptively counter potential foreign tied aid offers without triggering foreign tied aid use.(ii) ProcessIn handling individual applications involving the use or potential use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund the following process shall exclusively apply pursuant to subparagraph (A):(I) The Bank shall process an application for tied aid in accordance with the principles and standar", "ds developed pursuant to subparagraph (A) and clause (i) of this subparagraph.(II) Twenty days prior to the scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors at which an application will be considered (unless the Bank determines that an earlier discussion is appropriate based on the facts of a particular financing), the Bank shall brief the Secretary on the application and deliver to the Secretary such documents, information, or data as may reasonably be necessary to permit the Secretary to review the application to determine if the application complies with the principles and standards developed pursuant to subparagraph (A) and clause (i) of this subparagraph.(III) The Secretary may request a single postponement of the consideration by the Board of Directors of the application for up to 14 days to allow the Secretary to submit to the Board of Directors a memorandum objecting to the application.(IV) Case-by-case decisions on whether to approve the use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund shall be made by the Board of Directors, except that the approval of the Board of Directors (or a commitment letter based on that approval) shall not become final (except as provided in subclause (V)), if the Secretary indicates to the President of the Bank in writing the Secretary\u2019s intention to appeal the decision of the Board of Directors to the President of the United States and makes the appeal in writing not later than 20 days after the meeting at which the Board of Directors considered the application.(V) The Bank shall not grant final approval of an application for any tied aid credit (or a commitment letter based on that approval) if the President of the United States, after consulting with the President of the Bank and the Secretary, determines within 30 days of an appeal by the Secretary under subclause (IV) that the extension of the tied aid credit would materially impede achieving the purposes described in subsection (a)(6). If no such Presidential determination is made during the 30-day period, the approval by the Bank of the appl", "ication (or related commitment letter) that was the subject of such appeal shall become final.(C) Initial principles, process, and standardsAs soon as is practicable but not later than 6 months after June 14, 2002(D) Transitional principles and standardsThe principles and standards set forth in subparagraph (B)(i) shall govern the use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund until the principles, process, and standards required by subparagraph (C) are submitted.(E) Update and revisionThe Secretary and the Bank jointly should update and revise, as needed, the principles, process, and standards developed pursuant to subparagraph (A), and, on doing so, shall submit to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate a copy of the principles, process, and standards so updated and revised.(6) Reconsideration of decisions(A) In generalTaking into consideration the time sensitivity of transactions, the Board of Directors of the Bank shall expeditiously pursuant to paragraph (2) reconsider a decision of the Board to deny an application for the use of the Tied Aid Credit Fund if the applicant submits the request for reconsideration within 3 months of the denial.(B) Procedural rulesIn any such reconsideration, the applicant may be required to provide new information on the application.(c) Tied Aid Credit Fund(1) In generalThere is hereby established within the Bank a fund to be known as the \u201cTied Aid Credit Fund\u201d (hereinafter in this section referred to as the \u201cFund\u201d), consisting of such amounts as may be appropriated to the Fund pursuant to the authorization contained in subsection (e).(2) Expenditures from FundAmounts in the Fund shall be available for grants made by the Bank under the tied aid credit program established pursuant to subsection (b) and to reimburse the Bank for the amount equal to the concessionality level of any tied aid credits authorized by the Bank.(d) Consistency with ArrangementAny export financing involving the use of a gr", "ant under the tied aid credit program shall be consistent with the procedures established by the Arrangement, as in effect at the time such financing is approved.(e) AuthorizationThere are authorized to be appropriated to the Fund such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

Purchase and sale of mortgages; residential mortgages; conventional mortgages; terms and conditions of sale or other disposition; authority to enter into, perform, and carry out transactions(a) Authority for purchase and sale; residential mortgages; conventional mortgages; terms and conditions of sale or other disposition; lending activities(1) The Corporation is authorized to purchase, and make commitments to purchase, residential mortgages. The Corporation may hold and deal with, and sell or otherwise dispose of, pursuant to commitments or otherwise, any such mortgage or interest therein. The operations of the Corporation under this section shall be confined so far as practicable to residential mortgages which are deemed by the Corporation to be of such quality, type, and class as to meet generally the purchase standards imposed by private institutional mortgage investors. The Corporation may establish requirements, and impose charges or fees, which may be regarded as elements of pricing, for different classes of sellers or servicers, and for such purposes the Corporation is authorized to classify sellers or servicers according to type, size, location, assets, or, without limitation on the generality of the foregoing, on such other basis or bases of differentiation as the Corporation may consider necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes or provisions of this chapter. Th", "e Corporation may specify requirements concerning among other things, (A) minimum net worth; (B) supervisory mechanisms; (C) warranty compensation mechanisms; (D) prior approval of facilities; (E) prior origination and servicing experience with respect to different types of mortgages; (F) capital contributions and substitutes; (G) mortgage purchase volume limits; and (H) reduction of mortgage purchases during periods of borrowing. With respect to any particular type of seller, the Corporation shall not be required to make available programs involving prior approval of mortgages, optional delivery of mortgages, and purchase of other than conventional mortgages to an extent greater than the Corporation elects to make such programs available to other types of eligible sellers. Any requirements specified by the Corporation pursuant to the preceding three sentences must bear a rational relationship to the purposes or provisions of this chapter, but will not be considered discriminatory solely on the grounds of differential effects on types of eligible sellers. Insofar as is practicable, the Corporation shall make reasonable efforts to encourage participation in its programs by each type of eligible seller. Nothing in this section authorizes the Corporation to impose any charge or fee upon any mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for participation in any mortgage insurance program under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701(2) No conventional mortgage secured by a property comprising one- to four-family dwelling units shall be purchased under this section if the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage at the time of purchase exceeds 80 per centum of the value of the property securing the mortgage, unless (A) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; (B) for such period and under such circumstances as the Corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the Corporation in the event that the mo", "rtgage is in default; or (C) that portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage which is in excess of such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the Corporation. The Corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a conventional mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (A) of such sentence. The Corporation may purchase a conventional mortgage which was originated more than one year prior to the purchase date only if the seller is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, or any other seller currently engaged in mortgage lending or investing activities. With respect to any transaction in which a seller contemporaneously sells mortgages originated more than one year old prior to the date of sale to the Corporation and receives in payment for such mortgages securities representing undivided interests only in those mortgages, the Corporation shall not impose any fee or charge upon an eligible seller which is not a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank which differs from that imposed upon an eligible seller which is such a member. The Corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of conventional mortgages that are purchased by it; in any case in which the Corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of the mortgage and not merely with respect to the interest purchased by the Corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed $417,000 for a mortgage secured by a single-family residence, $533,850 for a mortgage secured by a 2-family residence, $645,300 for a mortgage secured by a 3-family residence, and $801,950 for a mortgage secured by a 4-family residence, except that such maximum limitations s", "hall be adjusted effective January 1 of each year beginning after the effective date of the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008, subject to the limitations in this paragraph. Each adjustment shall be made by adding to each such amount (as it may have been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to the percentage increase, during the most recent 12-month or 4-quarter period ending before the time of determining such annual adjustment, in the housing price index maintained by the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (pursuant to section 4542 of this title(3) The sale or other disposition by the Corporation of a mortgage under this section may be with or without recourse, and shall be upon such terms and conditions relating to resale, repurchase, guaranty, substitution, replacement, or otherwise as the Corporation may prescribe.(4)(A) The Corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in (i) residential mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a one- to four-family residence that is the principal residence of the mortgagor; and (ii) residential mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a property comprising five or more family dwelling units. If the Corporation shall have purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with any other outstanding mortgage secured by the same residence, the aggregate original amount of such other mortgage and the mortgage authorized to be purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with under this paragraph shall not exceed the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).(B) The Corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of such mortgages. In any case in which the Corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of such mortgage secured by a subordinate lien and not merely with respect to the interest pur", "chased by the Corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed (i) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(i), 50 per centum of the single-family residence mortgage limitation determined under paragraph (2); and (ii) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).(C) No subordinate mortgage against a one- to four-family residence shall be purchased by the Corporation if the total outstanding indebtedness secured by the property as a result of such mortgage exceeds 80 per centum of the value of such property unless (i) that portion of such total outstanding indebtedness that exceeds such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the Corporation; (ii) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; or (iii) for such period and under such circumstances as the Corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the Corporation in the event that the mortgage is in default. The Corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a subordinate mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (iii) of such sentence.(5) The Corporation is authorized to lend on the security of, and to make commitments to lend on the security of, any mortgage that the Corporation is authorized to purchase under this section. The volume of the Corporation\u2019s lending activities and the establishment of its loan ratios, interest rates, maturities, and charges or fees in its secondary market operations under this paragraph, shall be determined by the Corporation from time to time; and such determinations shall be consistent with the objectives that the lending activities shall be conducted on such terms as will reasonably prevent excessive use of the Corporation\u2019s facilities, and that the operations of the Corpo", "ration under this paragraph shall be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations shall be fully self-supporting. The Corporation shall not be permitted to use its lending authority under this paragraph (A) to advance funds to a mortgage seller on an interim basis, using mortgage loans as collateral, pending the sale of the mortgages in the secondary market; or (B) to originate mortgage loans.

National Institute of Building Sciences(a) Congressional findings and declaration of purpose(1) The Congress finds (A) that the lack of an authoritative national source to make findings and to advise both the public and private sectors of the economy with respect to the use of building science and technology in achieving nationally acceptable standards and other technical provision for use in Federal, State, and local housing and building regulations is an obstacle ", "to efforts by and imposes severe burdens upon all those who procure, design, construct, use, operate, maintain, and retire physical facilities, and frequently results in the failure to take full advantage of new and useful developments in technology which could improve our living environment; (B) that the establishment of model buildings codes or of a single national building code will not completely resolve the problem because of the difficulty at all levels of government in updating their housing and building regulations to reflect new developments in technology, as well as the irregularities and inconsistencies which arise in applying such requirements to particular localities or special local conditions; (C) that the lack of uniform housing and building regulatory provisions increases the costs of construction and thereby reduces the amount of housing and other community facilities which can be provided; and (D) that the existence of a single authoritative nationally recognized institution to provide for the evaluation of new technology could facilitate introduction of such innovations and their acceptance at the Federal, State, and local levels.(2) The Congress further finds, however, that while an authoritative source of technical findings is needed, various private organizations and institutions, private industry, labor, and Federal and other governmental agencies and entities are presently engaged in building research, technology development, testing, and evaluation, standards and model code development and promulgation, and information dissemination. These existing activities should be encouraged and these capabilities effectively utilized wherever possible and appropriate to the purposes of this section.(3) The Congress declares that an authoritative nongovernmental instrument needs to be created to address the problems and issues described in paragraph (1), that the creation of such an instrument should be initiated by the Government, with the advice and assistance of the National Academy of Sciences-N", "ational Academy of Engineering-National Research Council (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cAcademies-Research Council\u201d) and of the various sectors of the building community, including labor and management, technical experts in building science and technology, and the various levels of government.(b) Establishment; advice and assistance of Academies-Research Council and other agencies and organizations knowledgeable in building technology(1) There is authorized to be established, for the purposes described in subsection (a)(3), an appropriate nonprofit, non\u00adgovernmental instrument to be known as the National Institute of Building Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cInstitute\u201d), which shall not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government.

The Congress further finds that the present programs for housing the elderly under the Department of Housing and Urban Development have proven the value of Federal credit assistance in this field and at the same time demonstrated the urgent need for an expanded and more comprehensive effort to meet our responsibilities to our senior citizens.(Pub.

This objective has been contemplated in Federal housing legislation since the establishment of mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration.The Congress commends the Department of Housing and Urban Development for its recent efforts to improve architectural standards through competitive design awards and in other ways but at the same time recognizes that this important objective requires high priority if Federal aid is to make its full communitywide contribution toward improving our urban environment.The Congress further finds that even within the necessary budget limitations on housing for low and moderate income families architectural design could be improved not only to make the housing more attractive, but to make it better suited to the needs of occupants.The ", "Congress declares that in the administration of housing programs which assist in the provision of housing for low and moderate income families, emphasis should be given to encouraging good design as an essential component of such housing and to developing housing which will be of such quality as to reflect its important relationship to the architectural standards of the neighborhood and community in which it is situated, consistent with prudent budgeting.(Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title [amending sections 1715z\u20136 and 1715z\u201315 of this title and sections 1437f, 1472, 1485, and 1487 of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare] may be cited as the \u2018Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987\u2019.\u201cSEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715l\u201c(2) in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f\u201c(3) some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1485\u201c(4) the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income hous", "ing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;\u201c(5) the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as\u2014\u201c(A) providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;\u201c(B) increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and\u201c(C) expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;\u201c(6) the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;\u201c(7) recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;\u201c(8) efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;\u201c(9) a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and\u201c(10) until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.\u201c(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this title\u2014\u201c(1) to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;\u201c(2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing", "; and\u201c(3) to continue the partnership between all levels of government and the private sector in the production and operation of housing that is affordable to low income Americans.\u201cSEC. 203.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1715l\u201c(2) in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f\u201c(3) some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1485\u201c(4) the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;\u201c(5) the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as\u2014\u201c(A) providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;\u201c(B) increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and\u201c(C) expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;\u201c(6) the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;\u201c(7) recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to", " withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;\u201c(8) efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;\u201c(9) a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and\u201c(10) until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.\u201c(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this title\u2014\u201c(1) to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;\u201c(2) to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing; and\u201c(3) to continue the partnership between all levels of government and the private sector in the production and operation of housing that is affordable to low income Americans. \u201cSEC. 203.
