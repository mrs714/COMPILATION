Except in cases covered by formula C, the pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were themselves enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The provisos of 10:1002 and 1005 are omitted as surplusage, since no formula for the computation of retired pay incl", "udes inactive service on the retired list as a credit.The words \u201cat rates applicable on date of retirement and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates\u201d, in footnote 2; and all of footnote 4; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 2 and 4 apply.In footnote 4, the words \u201cand disregard a part of a year that is less than six months\u201d are made applicable to formulas A\u2013E, although this part of the rule is expressed only as to formula B, in 10:941a(4)(1).

L. 117\u2013151, \u00a7\u202f2(a)June 21, 2022136 Stat. 1298\nHistorical and Revision Noteslegislative statementsSection 101(2) defines \u201caffiliate.\u201d The House amendment contains a provision that is a compromise between the definition in the House-passed version of H.R. 8200 and the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 8200. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) are derived from the Senate amendment and subparagraph (D) is taken from the House bill, while subparagraph (C) represents a compromise, taking the House position with respect to a person whose business is operated under a lease or an operating agreement by the debtor and with respect to a person substantially all of whose property is operated under an operating agreement by the debtor and with respect to a person substantially all of whose property is operated under an operating agreement by the debtor and the Senate position on leased property. Thus, the definition of \u201caffiliate\u201d excludes persons substantially all of whose property is operated under a lease agreement by a debtor, such as a small company which ", "owns equipment all of which is leased to a larger nonrelated company.Section 101(4)(B) represents a modification of the House-passed bill to include the definition of \u201cclaim\u201d a right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a right to payment. This is intended to cause the liquidation or estimation of contingent rights of payment for which there may be an alternative equitable remedy with the result that the equitable remedy will be susceptible to being discharged in bankruptcy. For example, in some States, a judgment for specific performance may be satisfied by an alternative right to payment, in the event performance is refused; in that event, the creditor entitled to specific performance would have a \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of a proceeding under title 11.On the other hand, rights to an equitable remedy for a breach of performance with respect to which such breach does not give rise to a right to payment are not \u201cclaims\u201d and would therefore not be susceptible to discharge in bankruptcy.In a case under chapter 9 to title 11, \u201cclaim\u201d does not include a right to payment under an industrial development bond issued by a municipality as a matter of convenience for a third party.Municipalities are authorized, under section 103(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended [title 26], to issue tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds to provide for the financing of certain projects for privately owned companies. The bonds are sold on the basis of the credit of the company on whose behalf they are issued, and the principal, interest, and premium, if any, are payable solely from payments made by the company to the trustee under the bond indenture and do not constitute claims on the tax revenues or other funds of the issuing municipalities. The municipality merely acts as the vehicle to enable the bonds to be issued on a tax-exempt basis. Claims that arise by virtue of these bonds are not among the claims defined by this paragraph and amounts owed by private companies to the ", "holders of industrial development revenue bonds are not to be included among the assets of the municipality that would be affected by the plan.Section 101(6) defines \u201ccommunity claim\u201d as provided by the Senate amendment in order to indicate that a community claim exists whether or not there is community property in the estate as of the commencement of the case.Section 101(7) of the House amendment contains a definition of consumer debt identical to the definition in the House bill and Senate amendment. A consumer debt does not include a debt to any extent the debt is secured by real property.Section 101(9) of the Senate amendment contained a definition of \u201ccourt.\u201d The House amendment deletes the provision as unnecessary in light of the pervasive jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court under all chapters of title 11 as indicated in title II of the House amendment to H.R. 8200.Section 101(11) defines \u201cdebt\u201d to mean liability on a claim, as was contained in the House-passed version of H.R. 8200. The Senate amendment contained language indicating that \u201cdebt\u201d does not include a policy loan made by a life insurance company to the debtor. That language is deleted in the House amendment as unnecessary since a life insurance company clearly has no right to have a policy loan repaid by the debtor, although such company does have a right of offset with respect to such policy loan. Clearly, then, a \u201cdebt\u201d does not include a policy loan made by a life insurance company. Inclusion of the language contained in the Senate amendment would have required elaboration of other legal relationships not arising by a liability on a claim. Further the language would have required clarification that interest on a policy loan made by a life insurance company is a debt, and that the insurance company does have right to payment to that interest.Section 101(14) adopts the definition of \u201centity\u201d contained in the Senate-passed version of H.R. 8200. Since the Senate amendment to H.R. 8200 deleted the U.S. trustee, a corresponding definitional change i", "s made in chapter 15 of the House amendment for U.S. trustees under the pilot program. Adoption by the House amendment of a pilot program for U.S. trustees under chapter 15 requires insertion of \u201cUnited States trustee\u201d in many sections. Several provisions in chapter 15 of the House amendment that relate to the U.S. trustee were not contained in the Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute.Section 101(17) defines \u201cfarmer,\u201d as in the Senate amendment with an income limitation percentage of 80 percent instead of 75 percent.Section 101(18) contains a new definition of \u201cfarming operation\u201d derived from present law and the definition of \u201cfarmer\u201d in the Senate amendment. This definition gives a broad construction to the term \u201cfarming operation\u201d.Section 101(20) contains a definition of \u201cforeign representative\u201d. It clarifies the House bill and Senate amendment by indicating that a foreign representative must be duly selected in a foreign proceeding.Section 101(35) defines \u201csecurity\u201d as contained in the Senate amendment. H.R. 8200 as adopted by the House excluded certain commercial notes from the definition of \u201csecurity\u201d, and that exclusion is deleted.Section 101(40) defines \u201ctransfer\u201d as in the Senate amendment. The definition contained in H.R. 8200 as passed by the House included \u201csetoff\u201d in the definition of \u201ctransfer\u201d. Inclusion of \u201csetoff\u201d is deleted. The effect is that a \u201csetoff\u201d is not subject to being set aside as a preferential \u201ctransfer\u201d but will be subject to special rules.senate report no. 95\u2013989Section 101 of title 11Paragraph (1) defines \u201caccountant\u201d as an accountant authorized under applicable law to practice accounting. The term includes a professional accounting association, corporation, or partnership if applicable law authorizes such a unit to practice accounting.Paragraph (2) defines \u201caffiliate.\u201d An affiliate is an entity with a close relationship to the debtor. It includes a 20 percent parent or subsidiary of the debtor, whether a corporate, partnership, individual, or estate parent.The use of \u201cdi", "rectly or indirectly\u201d in subparagraphs (A) and (B) is intended to cover situations in which there is an opportunity to control, and where the existence of that opportunity operates as indirect control.\u201cAffiliate\u201d is defined primarily for use in the definition of insider, infra, and for use in the chapter 11 reorganization cases. The definition of \u201caffiliate\u201d does not include an entity acting in a fiduciary or agency capacity if the entity does not have the sole discretionary power to vote 20 percent of the voting securities but hold them solely as security and have not exercised the power to vote. This restriction applies to a corporate affiliate under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2).Subsections (C) and (D) of paragraph (2) define affiliate also as those persons and entities whose business or substantially all of whose property is operated under a lease or operating agreement by a debtor and whose business or property is more than 50 percent under the control of the debtor.The definition of \u201cattorney\u201d in paragraph (3) is similar to the definition of accountant.Paragraph (4) defines \u201cclaim.\u201d The effect of the definition is a significant departure from present law. Under present law, \u201cclaim\u201d is not defined in straight bankruptcy. Instead it is simply used, along with the concept of provability in section 63 of the Bankruptcy Act [section 103 of former title 11], to limit the kinds of obligations that are payable in a bankruptcy case. The term is defined in the debtor rehabilitation chapters of present law far more broadly. The definition in paragraph (4) adopts an even broader definition of claim than is found in the present debtor rehabilitation chapters. The definition is any right to payment, whether or not reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured. The definition also includes as a claim an equitable right to performance that does not give rise to a right to payment. By this broadest possible definition a", "nd by the use of the term throughout the title 11, especially in subchapter I of chapter 5, the bill contemplates that all legal obligations of the debtor, no matter how remote or contingent, will be able to be dealt with in the bankruptcy case. It permits the broadest possible relief in the bankruptcy court.Paragraph (5) defines \u201ccommodity broker\u201d by reference to various terms used and defined in subchapter IV of chapter 7, Commodity Broker Liquidation. The terms are described in connection with section 761, infra.Paragraph (6) defines \u201ccommunity claim\u201d for those eight States that have community property laws. The definition is keyed to the liability of the debtor\u2019s property for a claim against either the debtor or the debtor\u2019s spouse. If the debtor\u2019s property is liable for a claim against either, that claim is a community claim.Paragraph (7) defines \u201cconsumer debt\u201d. The definition is adapted from the definition used in various consumer protection laws. It encompasses only a debt incurred by an individual primarily for a personal, family, or household purpose.The definition of \u201ccorporation\u201d in paragraph (8) is similar to the definition in current law, section 1(8) [section 1(8) of former title 11]. The term encompasses any association having the power or privilege that a private corporation, but not an individual or partnership, has; partnership associations organized under a law that makes only the capital subscribed responsible for the debts of the partnership; joint-stock company; unincorporated company or association; and business trust. \u201cUnincorporated association\u201d is intended specifically to include a labor union, as well as other bodies that come under that phrase as used under current law. The exclusion of limited partnerships is explicit, and not left to the case law.Paragraph (9) defines \u201ccourt\u201d as the bankruptcy judge in the district in which the case is pending except in municipal adjustment and railroad reorganization cases, where \u201ccourt\u201d means the Federal district judge.Paragraph (10) [enacted as (", "9)] defines \u201ccreditor\u201d to include holders of prepetition claims against the debtor. However, it also encompasses certain holders of claims that are deemed to arise before the date of the filing of the petition, such as those injured by the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease, certain investment tax credit recapture claim holders, \u201cinvoluntary gap\u201d creditors, and certain holders of the right of setoff. The term also includes the holder of a prepetition community claim. A guarantor of or surety for a claim against the debtor is also a creditor, because he holds a contingent claim against the debtor that becomes fixed when he pays the creditor whose claim he has guaranteed or insured.Paragraph (11) [enacted as (10)] defines \u201ccustodian.\u201d There is no similar definition in current law. It is defined to facilitate drafting, and means a prepetition liquidator of the debtor\u2019s property, such as an assignee for the benefit of creditors, a receiver of the debtor\u2019s property, or administrator of the debtor\u2019s property. The definition of custodian to include a receiver or trustee is descriptive, and not meant to be limited to court officers with those titles. The definition is intended to include other officers of the court if their functions are substantially similar to those of a receiver or trustee.\u201cDebt\u201d is defined in paragraph (12) [enacted as (11)] as a liability on a claim. The terms \u201cdebt\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d are coextensive: a creditor has a \u201cclaim\u201d against the debtor; the debtor owes a \u201cdebt\u201d to the creditor. This definition of \u201cdebt\u201d and the definition of \u201cclaim\u201d on which it is based, proposed 11 U.S.C. 101(4)11 U.S.C. 523Paragraph (13) [enacted as (12)] defines \u201cdebtor.\u201d Debtor means person or municipality concerning which a case under title II has been commenced. This is a change in terminology from present law, which identifies the person by or against whom a petition is filed in a straight bankruptcy liquidation case as the \u201cbankrupt\u201d, and a person or municipality that is proceeding under a debtor rehabi", "litation chapter (chapters VIII through XIII of the Bankruptcy Act) [chapters 8 through 13 of former title 11] as a \u201cdebtor.\u201d The term \u201cdebtor\u201d is used for both kinds of cases in this bill, for ease of reference in chapters 1, 3, and 5 (which apply to straight bankruptcy and reorganization cases).Paragraph (14) [enacted as (13)] defines \u201cdisinterested person.\u201d The definition is adapted from section 158 of chapter X of current law [section 558 of former title 11], though it is expanded and modified in some respects. A person is a disinterested person if the person is not a creditor, equity security holder, or insider; is not and was not an investment banker of the debtor for any outstanding security of the debtor (the change from underwriter in current law to investment banker is to make the term more descriptive and to avoid conflict with the definition of underwriter in section 2(11) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77b(11)15 U.S.C. 77m\u201cEntity\u201d is defined, for convenience, in paragraph (15) [enacted as (14)], to include person, estate, trust, and governmental unit. It is the most inclusive of the various defined terms relating to bodies or units.Paragraph (16) defines \u201cequity security.\u201d The term includes a share or stock in a corporation, a limited partner\u2019s interest in a limited partnership, and a warrant or right to subscribe to an equity security. The term does not include a security, such as a convertible debenture, that is convertible into equity security, but has not been converted.Paragraph (17) [enacted as (15)] defines \u201cequity security holder\u201d for convenience as the holder of an equity securing of the debtor.Paragraph (18) [enacted as (17)] defines \u201cfarmer\u201d. It encompasses only those persons for whom farming operations contribute 75 percent or more of their total income.Paragraphs (19) and (20) define \u201cforeign proceeding\u201d and \u201cforeign representative\u201d. A foreign proceeding is a proceeding in another country in which the debtor has some substantial connection for the purpose of liquidating the est"]
