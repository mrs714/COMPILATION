Findings and statement of purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) wetlands play an integral role in maintaining the quality of life through material contributions to our national economy, food supply, water supply and quality, flood control, and fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and thus to the health, safety, recreation, and economic well-being of all our citizens of the Nation;(2) wetlands provide habitat essential for the breeding, spawning, nesting, migration, wintering and ultimate survival of a major portion of the migratory and resident fish and wildlife of the Nation; including migratory birds, endangered species, commercially and recreationally important finfish, shellfish and other aquatic organisms, and contain many unique species and communities of wild plants;(3) the migratory bird treaty obligations of the Nation with Canada, Mexico, Japan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and with various countries in the Western Hemisphere require Federal protection of wetlands that are used by migratory birds for breeding, wintering or migration and needed to achieve and to maintain optimum population levels, distributions, and patterns of migration;(4) wetlands, and the fish, wildlife, and plants dependent on wetlands, provide significant recreational and commercial benefits, including\u2014(A) contributions to a commercial marine harvest valued at over $10,000,000,000 annually;(B) support for a major portion of the Nation\u2019s multimillion dollar annual fur and hide harvest; and(C) fishing, hunting, birdwatching, nature observation and other wetland-related recreational activities that generate billions of dollars annually;(5) wetlands enhance the water quality and water supply of the Nation by serving as groundwater recharge areas, nutrient traps, and chemical sinks;(6) wetlands provide a natural means of flood and erosion control by retaining water during periods of high runoff, thereby protecting against loss of life and property;(7) wetla", "nds constitute only a small percentage of the land area of the United States, are estimated to have been reduced by half in the contiguous States since the founding of our Nation, and continue to disappear by hundreds of thousands of acres each year;(8) certain activities of the Federal Government have inappropriately altered or assisted in the alteration of wetlands, thereby unnecessarily stimulating and accelerating the loss of these valuable resources and the environmental and economic benefits that they provide; and(9) the existing Federal, State, and private cooperation in wetlands conservation should be strengthened in order to minimize further losses of these valuable areas and to assure their management in the public interest for this and future generations.(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this chapter to promote, in concert with other Federal and State statutes and programs, the conservation of the wetlands of the Nation in order to maintain the public benefits they provide and to help fulfill international obligations contained in various migratory bird treaties and conventions with Canada, Mexico, Japan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and with various countries in the Western Hemisphere by\u2014(1) intensifying cooperative efforts among private interests and local, State, and Federal governments for the management and conservation of wetlands; and(2) intensifying efforts to protect the wetlands of the Nation through acquisition in fee, easements or other interests and methods by local, State, and Federal governments and the private sector.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) Elephant populations in Africa have declined at an alarming rate since the mid-1970\u2019s.(2) The large illegal trade in African elephant ivory is the major cause of this decline and threatens the continued existence of the African elephant.(3) The African elephant is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S", ".C. 1531(4) Because African elephant ivory is indistinguishable from Asian elephant ivory, there is a need to ensure that the trade in African elephant ivory does not further endanger the Asian elephant, which is listed as endangered under section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(5) In response to the significant illegal trade in African elephant ivory, the parties to CITES established the CITES Ivory Control System to curtail the illegal trade and to encourage African countries to manage, conserve, and protect their African elephant populations.(6) The CITES Ivory Control System entered into force recently and should be allowed to continue in force for a reasonable period of time to assess its effectiveness in curtailing the illegal trade in African elephant ivory.(7) Although some African countries have effective African elephant conservation programs, many do not have sufficient resources to properly manage, conserve, and protect their elephant populations.(8) The United States, as a party to CITES and a large market for worked ivory, shares responsibility for supporting and implementing measures to stop the illegal trade in African elephant ivory and to provide for the conservation of the African elephant.(9) There is no evidence that sport hunting is part of the poaching that contributes to the illegal trade in African elephant ivory, and there is evidence that the proper utilization of well-managed elephant populations provides an important source of funding for African elephant conservation programs.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) Asian elephant populations in nations within the range of Asian elephants have continued to decline to the point that the long-", "term survival of the species in the wild is in serious jeopardy.(2) The Asian elephant is listed as an endangered species under section 1533 of this title(3) Because the challenges facing the conservation of Asian elephants are so great, resources to date have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of habitat and the consequent diminution of Asian elephant populations.(4) The Asian elephant is a flagship species for the conservation of tropical forest habitats in which it is found and provides the consequent benefit from such conservation to numerous other species of wildlife including many other endangered species.(5) Among the threats to the Asian elephant in addition to habitat loss are population fragmentation, human-elephant conflict, poaching for ivory, meat, hide, bones and teeth, and capture for domestication.(6) To reduce, remove, or otherwise effectively address these threats to the long-term viability of populations of Asian elephants in the wild will require the joint commitment and effort of nations within the range of Asian elephants, the United States and other countries, and the private sector.(Pub.

Findings and statement of purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds and declares that\u2014(1) the maintenance of healthy populations of migratory birds in North America is dependent on the protection, restoration, and management of wetland ecosystems and associated habitats in Canada, a", "s well as in the United States and Mexico;(2) wetland ecosystems provide essential and significant habitat for fish, shellfish, and other wildlife of commercial, recreational, scientific, and aesthetic values;(3) almost 35 per centum of all rare, threatened, and endangered species of animals are dependent on wetland ecosystems;(4) wetland ecosystems provide substantial flood and storm control values and can obviate the need for expensive manmade control measures;(5) wetland ecosystems make a significant contribution to water availability and quality, recharging ground water, filtering surface runoff, and providing waste treatment;(6) wetland ecosystems provide aquatic areas important for recreational and aesthetic purposes;(7) more than 50 per centum of the original wetlands in the United States alone have been lost;(8) wetlands destruction, loss of nesting cover, and degradation of migration and wintering habitat have contributed to long-term downward trends in populations of migratory bird species such as pintails, American bitterns, and black ducks;(9) the migratory bird treaty obligations of the United States with Canada, Mexico, and other countries require protection of wetlands that are used by migratory birds for breeding, wintering, or migration and are needed to achieve and to maintain optimum population levels, distributions, and patterns of migration;(10) the 1988 amendments to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980 require the Secretary of the Interior to identify conservation measures to assure that nongame migratory bird species do not reach the point at which measures of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [16 U.S.C. 1531(11) protection of migratory birds and their habitats requires long-term planning and the close cooperation and coordination of management activities by Canada, Mexico, and the United States within the framework of the 1916 and 1936 Migratory Bird Conventions and the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere;(12) the North American W", "aterfowl Management Plan, signed in 1986 by the Minister of Environment for Canada and the Secretary of the Interior for the United States and in 1994 by the Secretary of Sedesol for Mexico, provides a framework for maintaining and restoring an adequate habitat base to ensure perpetuation of populations of North American waterfowl and other migratory bird species;(13) a tripartite agreement signed in March 1988, by the Director General for Ecological Conservation of Natural Resources of Mexico, the Director of the Canadian Wildlife Service, and the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, provides for expanded cooperative efforts in Mexico to conserve wetlands for migratory birds that spend the winter there;(14) the long-term conservation of migratory birds and habitat for these species will require the coordinated action of governments, private organizations, landowners, and other citizens; and(15) the treaty obligations of the United States under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as waterfowl habitat requires promotion of conservation and wise use of wetlands.(b) PurposeThe purposes of this chapter are to encourage partnership among public agencies and other interests\u2014(1) to protect, enhance, restore, and manage an appropriate distribution and diversity of wetland ecosystems and habitats associated with wetland ecosystems and other fish and wildlife in North America;(2) to maintain current or improved distributions of wetland associated migratory bird populations; and(3) to sustain an abundance of waterfowl and other wetland associated migratory birds consistent with the goals of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan, the United States Shorebird Conservation Plan, the North American Waterbird Conservation Plan, the Partners In Flight Conservation Plans, and the international obligations contained in the migratory bird treaties and conventions and other agreements with Canada, Mexico, and other countries.(Pub.

Findings and purposes(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) the discharge of untreated water in the ballast tanks of vessels and through other means results in unintentional introductions of nonindigenous species to fresh, brackish, and saltwater environments;(2) when environmental conditions are favorable, nonindigenous species become established, may compete with or prey upon native species of plants, fish, and wildlife, may carry diseases or parasites that affect native species, and may disrupt the aquatic environment and economy of affected nearshore areas;(3) the zebra mussel was unintentionally introduced into the Great Lakes and has infested\u2014(A) waters south of the Great Lakes, into a good portion of the Mississippi River drainage;(B) waters west of the Great Lakes, into the Arkansas River in Oklahoma; and(C) waters east of the Great Lakes, into the Hudson River and Lake Champlain;(4) the potential economic disruption to communities affected by the zebra mussel due to its colonization of water pipes, boat hulls and other hard surfaces has been estimated at $5,000,000,000 by the year 2000, and the potential disruption to the diversity and abundance of native fish and other species by the zebra mussel and ruffe, round goby, and other nonindigenous species could be severe;(5) the zebra mussel was discovered on Lake Champlain during 1993 and the opportunity exists to act quickly to establish zebra mussel controls before Lake Champlain is further infested and management costs escalate;(6) in 1992, the zebra mussel was discovered at the northernmost reaches of the Chesapeake Bay watershed;(7) th", "e zebra mussel poses an imminent risk of invasion in the main waters of the Chesapeake Bay;(8) since the Chesapeake Bay is the largest recipient of foreign ballast water on the East Coast, there is a risk of further invasions of other nonindigenous species;(9) the zebra mussel is only one example of thousands of nonindigenous species that have become established in waters of the United States and may be causing economic and ecological degradation with respect to the natural resources of waters of the United States;(10) since their introduction in the early 1980\u2019s in ballast water discharges, ruffe\u2014(A) have caused severe declines in populations of other species of fish in Duluth Harbor (in Minnesota and Wisconsin);(B) have spread to Lake Huron; and(C) are likely to spread quickly to most other waters in North America if action is not taken promptly to control their spread;(11) examples of nonindigenous species that, as of October 26, 1996(A) the mitten crab (Eriocher sinensis) that has become established on the Pacific Coast;(B) the green crab (Carcinus maenas) that has become established in the coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean;(C) the brown mussel (Perna perna) that has become established along the Gulf of Mexico; and(D) certain shellfish pathogens;(12) many aquatic nuisance vegetation species, such as Eurasian watermilfoil, hydrilla, water hyacinth, and water chestnut, have been introduced to waters of the United States from other parts of the world causing or having a potential to cause adverse environmental, ecological, and economic effects;(13) if preventive management measures are not taken nationwide to prevent and control unintentionally introduced nonindigenous aquatic species in a timely manner, further introductions and infestations of species that are as destructive as, or more destructive than, the zebra mussel or the ruffe infestations may occur;(14) once introduced into waters of the United States, aquatic nuisance species are unintentionally transported and introduced into inland lakes and rive", "rs by recreational boaters, commercial barge traffic, and a variety of other pathways; and(15) resolving the problems associated with aquatic nuisance species will require the participation and cooperation of the Federal Government and State governments, and investment in the development of prevention technologies.(b) PurposesThe purposes of this chapter are\u2014(1) to prevent unintentional introduction and dispersal of nonindigenous species into waters of the United States through ballast water management and other requirements;(2) to coordinate federally conducted, funded, or authorized research, prevention control, information dissemination and other activities regarding the zebra mussel and other aquatic nuisance species;(3) to develop and carry out environmentally sound control methods to prevent, monitor and control unintentional introductions of nonindigenous species from pathways other than ballast water exchange;(4) to understand and minimize economic and ecological impacts of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species that become established, including the zebra mussel; and(5) to establish a program of research and technology development and assistance to States in the management and removal of zebra mussels.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) In addition to habitat loss and local use, the international pet trade in wild-caught exotic birds is contributing to the decline of species in the wild, and the mortality associated with the trade remains unacceptably high.(2) The United States, as the world\u2019s largest importer of exotic birds and as a Party to the Convention, should play a substantial role in finding effective solutions to these problems, including assisting countries of origin in implementing programs of wild bird conservation, and ensuring that the market in the United States for exotic birds does not operate to the detriment of the survival of species in the wild.(3) Sustainable utilization of exotic birds has the potential to create economic value in them and their habitats, which will contribute to their conservation and promote the maintenance of biological diversity generally.(4) Utilization of exotic birds that is not sustainable should not be allowed.(5) Broad international attention has focused on the serious conservation and welfare problems which currently exist in the trade in wild-caught animals, including exotic birds.(6) Many countries have chosen not to export their wild birds for the pet trade. Their decisions shou", "ld be respected and their efforts should be supported.(7) Several countries that allow for the export of their wild birds often lack the means to develop or effectively implement scientifically based management plans, and these countries should be assisted in developing and implementing management plans to enable them to ensure that their wild bird trade is conducted humanely and at sustainable levels.(8) The major exotic bird exporting countries are Parties to the Convention.(9) The Convention recognizes that trade in species that are threatened with extinction, or that may become so, should be subject to strict regulation.(10) The necessary population assessments, monitoring programs, and appropriate remedial measures for species listed in Appendix II of the Convention are not always being undertaken in order to maintain species at levels above which they might become eligible for inclusion in Appendix I of the Convention.(11) Resolutions adopted pursuant to the Convention recommend that the Parties to the Convention take appropriate measures regarding trade in species of exotic birds that have significantly high mortality rates in transport, including suspension of trade for commercial purposes between Parties when appropriate.(12) Article XIV provides that the Convention in no way affects the right of any Party to the Convention to adopt stricter domestic measures for the regulation of trade in all species, whether or not listed in an Appendix to the Convention.(13) The United States prohibits the export of all birds native to the United States that are caught in the wild.(14) This chapter provides a series of nondiscriminatory measures that are necessary for the conservation of exotic birds, and furthers the obligations of the United States under the Convention.(Pub.

Findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) Coastal fishery resources that migrate, or are widely distributed, across the jurisdictional boundaries of two or more of the Atlantic States and of the Federal Government are of substantial commercial and recreational importance and economic benefit to the Atlantic coastal region and the Nation.(2) Increased fishing pressure, environmental pollution, and the loss and alteration of habitat have reduced severely certain Atlantic coastal fishery resources.(3) Because no single governmental en", "tity has exclusive management authority for Atlantic coastal fishery resources, harvesting of such resources is frequently subject to disparate, inconsistent, and intermittent State and Federal regulation that has been detrimental to the conservation and sustainable use of such resources and to the interests of fishermen and the Nation as a whole.(4) The responsibility for managing Atlantic coastal fisheries rests with the States, which carry out a cooperative program of fishery oversight and management through the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to support such cooperative interstate management of coastal fishery resources.(5) The failure by one or more Atlantic States to fully implement a coastal fishery management plan can affect the status of Atlantic coastal fisheries, and can discourage other States from fully implementing coastal fishery management plans.(6) It is in the national interest to provide for more effective Atlantic State fishery resource conservation and management.(b) PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to support and encourage the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective interstate conservation and management of Atlantic coastal fishery resources.(Pub.

Findings and purposes(a) FindingsThe Congress finds and declares the following:(1) Atlantic striped bass are of historic co", "mmercial and recreational importance and economic benefit to the Atlantic coastal States and to the Nation.(2) No single government entity has full management authority throughout the range of the Atlantic striped bass.(3) The population of Atlantic striped bass\u2014(A) has been subject to large fluctuations due to natural causes, fishing pressure, environmental pollution, loss and alteration of habitat, inadequacy of fisheries conservation and management practices, and other causes; and(B) risks potential depletion in the future without effective monitoring and conservation and management measures.(4) It is in the national interest to implement effective procedures and measures to provide for effective interjurisdictional conservation and management of this species.(b) PurposeIt is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in this chapter to support and encourage the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective interstate action regarding the conservation and management of the Atlantic striped bass.(Pub.

L. 105\u2013146\u201c(2) As a consequence of increased fishing pressure, environmental pollution, the loss and alteration of habitat, and the inadequacy of fishery conservation and management practices and controls, certain stocks of Atlantic striped bass have been severely reduced in number.\u201c(3) Because no single government entity has full management authority throughout the range of the Atlantic striped bass, the harvesting and conservation of these fish have been subject to diverse, inconsistent, and intermittent State regulation that has been detrimental to the long-term maintenance of stocks of the species and to the interests of fishermen and the Nation as a whole.\u201dStatutory Notes and Related SubsidiariesShort Title of 1997 AmendmentPub.

FindingsCongress finds that\u2014(1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and the large majority of those species, the neotropical migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean but breed in Canada and the United States;(2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;(3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in jeopardy; and(B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including pollution and contamination) across the species\u2019 range; and(4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across numerous international borders each year, their conservation requires the commitment and effort o", "f all countries along their migration routes; and(B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased coordination.(Pub.

Terrestrial carbon sinks absorb around 30 percent of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities each year. Here at home, America\u2019s forests absorb more than 10 percent of annual United States economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions. Conserving old-growth and mature forests on Federal lands while supporting and advancing climate-smart forestry and sustainable forest products is critical to protecting these and other ecosystem services provided by those forests.Despite their importance, the world\u2019s forests are quickly disappearing; only a small fraction of the world\u2019s mature and old-growth forests remains. Here at home, the primary threats to forests, including mature and old-growth forests, include climate impacts, catastrophic wildfires, insect infestation, and disease. We can and must take action to conserve, restore, reforest, and manage our magnificent forests here at home and, working closely with international partners, throughout ", "the world.It is the policy of my Administration, in consultation with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, as well as the private sector, nonprofit organizations, labor unions, and the scientific community, to pursue science-based, sustainable forest and land management; conserve America\u2019s mature and old-growth forests on Federal lands; invest in forest health and restoration; support indigenous traditional ecological knowledge and cultural and subsistence practices; honor Tribal treaty rights; and deploy climate-smart forestry practices and other nature-based solutions to improve the resilience of our lands, waters, wildlife, and communities in the face of increasing disturbances and chronic stress arising from climate impacts.

Findings and purposes(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) marine turtle populations have declined to the point that the long-term survival of the loggerhead, green, hawksbill, Kemp\u2019s ridley, olive ridley, and leatherback turtle in the wild is in serious jeopardy;(2) 6 of the 7 recognized species of marine turtles are listed as threatened or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531(3) because marine turtles are long-lived, late-maturing, and highly migratory, marine turtles are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of human exploitation and habitat loss;(4) illegal international trade seriously threatens wild populations of some marine turtle species, particularly the hawksbill turtle;(5) the challenges facing marine turtles are immense, and the resources available have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of nesting habitats caused by human activities and the consequent diminution of marine turtle populations;(6) because marine turtles are flagship species for the ecosystems in which marine turtles are found, sustaining healthy populations of marine turtles provides benefits to many other species of wildlife, including many other threatened or endangered species;(7) marine turtles are important components of the ecosystems that they inhabit, and studies of wild populations of marine turtles have provided important biological insights;(8) changes in marine turtle populations are most reliably indicated by changes in the numbers of nests and nesting females; and(9) the reduction, removal, or other effective addressing of the threats to the long-term viability of populations of mar", "ine turtles will require the joint commitment and effort of\u2014(A) countries that have within their boundaries marine turtle nesting habitats; and(B) persons with expertise in the conservation of marine turtles.(b) PurposeThe purpose of this chapter is to assist in the conservation of marine turtles, freshwater turtles, and tortoises and the habitats of marine turtles, freshwater turtles, and tortoises in foreign countries and territories of the United States by supporting and providing financial resources for projects\u2014(1) to conserve marine turtle, freshwater turtle, and tortoise habitats under the jurisdiction of United States Fish and Wildlife Service programs;(2) to conserve marine turtles, freshwater turtles, and tortoises in those habitats; and(3) to address other threats to the survival of marine turtles, freshwater turtles, and tortoises, including habitat loss, poaching of turtles or their eggs, and wildlife trafficking.(Pub.

Works of authorship include the following categories:(1) literary works;(2) musical works, including any accompanying words;(3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music;(4) pantomimes and choreographic works;(5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;(6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works;(7) sound recordings; and(8) architectural works.(b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.(Pub.

Since the present statutory language is substantially the same as the empowering language of the Constitution [Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u202f8, cl. 8], a recurring question has been whether the statutory and the constitutional provisions are coextensive. If so, the courts would be faced with the alternative of holding copy\u00adrightable something that Congress clearly did not intend to protect, or of holding constitutionally incapable of copyright something that Congress might one day want to protect. To avoid these equally undesirable results, the courts have indicated that \u201call the writings of an author\u201d under the present statute is narrower in scope than the \u201cwritings\u201d of \u201cauthors\u201d referred to in the Constitution. The bill avoids this dilemma by using a different phrase\u2014\u201coriginal works of authorship\u201d\u2014in characterizing the general subject matter of statutory copyright protection.The history of copyright law has been one of gradual expansion in the types of works accorded protection, and the subject matter affected by this expansion has fallen into two general categories. In the first, scientific discoveries and technological developments have made possible new forms of creative expression that never existed before. In some of these cases the new expressive forms\u2014electronic music, filmstrips, and computer programs, for example\u2014could be regarded as an extension of copyrightable subject matter Congress had already intended to protect, and were thus considered copyrightable from the outset without the need of new legislation. In other cases, such as photographs, sound recordings, and motion pictures, statutory enactment was deemed necessary to give them full recognition as copyrightable works.Authors are continually finding new ways of expressing t", "hemselves, but it is impossible to foresee the forms that these new expressive methods will take. The bill does not intend either to freeze the scope of copyrightable subject matter at the present stage of communications technology or to allow unlimited expansion into areas completely outside the present congressional intent. Section 102 implies neither that that subject matter is unlimited nor that new forms of expression within that general area of subject matter would necessarily be unprotected.The historic expansion of copyright has also applied to forms of expression which, although in existence for generations or centuries, have only gradually come to be recognized as creative and worthy of protection. The first copyright statute in this country, enacted in 1790, designated only \u201cmaps, charts, and books\u201d; major forms of expression such as music, drama, and works of art achieved specific statutory recognition only in later enactments. Although the coverage of the present statute is very broad, and would be broadened further by the explicit recognition of all forms of choreography, there are unquestionably other areas of existing subject matter that this bill does not propose to protect but that future Congresses may want to.Fixation in Tangible Form.White-Smith Publishing Co. v. Apollo CoUnder the bill, the concept of fixation is important since it not only determines whether the provisions of the statute apply to a work, but it also represents the dividing line between common law and statutory protection. As will be noted in more detail in connection with section 301, an unfixed work of authorship, such as an improvisation or an unrecorded choreographic work, performance, or broadcast, would continue to be subject to protection under State common law or statute, but would not be eligible for Federal statutory protection under section 102.The bill seeks to resolve, through the definition of \u201cfixation\u201d in section 101, the status of live broadcasts\u2014sports, news coverage, live performances of music, etc.\u2014that a", "re reaching the public in unfixed form but that are simultaneously being recorded. When a football game is being covered by four television cameras, with a director guiding the activities of the four cameramen and choosing which of their electronic images are sent out to the public and in what order, there is little doubt that what the cameramen and the director are doing constitutes \u201cauthorship.\u201d The further question to be considered is whether there has been a fixation. If the images and sounds to be broadcast are first recorded (on a video tape, film, etc.) and then transmitted, the recorded work would be considered a \u201cmotion picture\u201d subject to statutory protection against unauthorized reproduction or retransmission of the broadcast. If the program content is transmitted live to the public while being recorded at the same time, the case would be treated the same; the copyright owner would not be forced to rely on common law rather than statutory rights in proceeding against an infringing user of the live broadcast.Thus, assuming it is copyrightable\u2014as a \u201cmotion picture\u201d or \u201csound recording,\u201d for example\u2014the content of a live transmission should be regarded as fixed and should be accorded statutory protection if it is being recorded simultaneously with its transmission. On the other hand, the definition of \u201cfixation\u201d would exclude from the concept purely evanescent or transient reproductions such as those projected briefly on a screen, shown electronically on a television or other cathode ray tube, or captured momentarily in the \u201cmemory\u201d of a computer.Under the first sentence of the definition of \u201cfixed\u201d in section 101, a work would be considered \u201cfixed in a tangible medium of expression\u201d if there has been an authorized embodiment in a copy or phonorecord and if that embodiment \u201cis sufficiently permanent or stable\u201d to permit the work \u201cto be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\u201d The second sentence makes clear that, in the case of \u201ca work consisting of ", "sounds, images, or both, that are being transmitted,\u201d the work is regarded as \u201cfixed\u201d if a fixation is being made at the same time as the transmission.Under this definition \u201ccopies\u201d and \u201cphonorecords\u201d together will comprise all of the material objects in which copyrightable works are capable of being fixed. The definitions of these terms in section 101, together with their usage in section 102 and throughout the bill, reflect a fundamental distinction between the \u201coriginal work\u201d which is the product of \u201cauthorship\u201d and the multitude of material objects in which it can be embodied. Thus, in the sense of the bill, a \u201cbook\u201d is not a work of authorship, but is a particular kind of \u201ccopy.\u201d Instead, the author may write a \u201cliterary work,\u201d which in turn can be embodied in a wide range of \u201ccopies\u201d and \u201cphonorecords,\u201d including books, periodicals, computer punch cards, microfilm, tape recordings, and so forth. It is possible to have an \u201coriginal work of authorship\u201d without having a \u201ccopy\u201d or \u201cphonorecord\u201d embodying it, and it is also possible to have a \u201ccopy\u201d or \u201cphonorecord\u201d embodying something that does not qualify as an \u201coriginal work of authorship.\u201d The two essential elements\u2014original work and tangible object\u2014must merge through fixation in order to produce subject matter copyrightable under the statute.Categories of Copyrightable Works.section 5 of title 17Of the seven items listed, four are defined in section 101. The three undefined categories\u2014\u201cmusical works,\u201d \u201cdramatic works,\u201d and \u201cpantomimes and choreographic works\u201d\u2014have fairly settled meanings. There is no need, for example, to specify the copyrightability of electronic or concrete music in the statute since the form of a work would no longer be of any importance, nor is it necessary to specify that \u201cchoreographic works\u201d do not include social dance steps and simple routines.The four items defined in section 101 are \u201cliterary works,\u201d \u201cpictorial, graphic, and sculptural works,\u201d \u201cmotion pictures and audiovisual works\u201d, and \u201csound recordings\u201d. In each of these cases,", " definitions are needed not only because the meaning of the term itself is unsettled but also because the distinction between \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cmaterial object\u201d requires clarification. The term \u201cliterary works\u201d does not connote any criterion of literary merit or qualitative value: it includes catalogs, directories, and similar factual, reference, or instructional works and compilations of data. It also includes computer data bases, and computer programs to the extent that they incorporate authorship in the programmer\u2019s expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves.Correspondingly, the definition of \u201cpictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\u201d carries with it no implied criterion of artistic taste, aesthetic value, or intrinsic quality. The term is intended to comprise not only \u201cworks of art\u201d in the traditional sense but also works of graphic art and illustration, art reproductions, plans and drawings, photographs and reproductions of them, maps, charts, globes, and other cartographic works, works of these kinds intended for use in advertising and commerce, and works of \u201capplied art.\u201d There is no intention whatever to narrow the scope of the subject matter now characterized in section 5(k) [section 5(k) of former title 17] as \u201cprints or labels used for articles of merchandise.\u201d However, since this terminology suggests the material object in which a work is embodied rather than the work itself, the bill does not mention this category separately.In accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Mazer v. SteinThe Committee has added language to the definition of \u201cpictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\u201d in an effort to make clearer the distinction between works of applied art protectable under the bill and industrial designs not subject to copyright protection. The declaration that \u201cpictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\u201d include \u201cworks of artistic craftsmanship insofar as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned\u201d is classic language; it is drawn from Copyright O", "ffice regulations promulgated in the 1940\u2019s and expressly endorsed by the Supreme Court in the MazerThe second part of the amendment states that \u201cthe design of a useful article *\u2000*\u2000* shall be considered a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independ\u00adently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\u201d A \u201cuseful article\u201d is defined as \u201can article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.\u201d This part of the amendment is an adaptation of language added to the Copyright Office Regulations in the mid-1950\u2019s in an effort to implement the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the MazerIn adopting this amendatory language, the Committee is seeking to draw as clear a line as possible between copyrightable works of applied art and uncopy\u00adrighted works of industrial design. A two-dimensional painting, drawing, or graphic work is still capable of being identified as such when it is printed on or applied to utilitarian articles such as textile fabrics, wallpaper, containers, and the like. The same is true when a statue or carving is used to embellish an industrial product or, as in the MazerA special situation is presented by architectural works. An architect\u2019s plans and drawings would, of course, be protected by copyright, but the extent to which that protection would extend to the structure depicted would depend on the circumstances. Purely nonfunctional or monumental structures would be subject to full copyright protection under the bill, and the same would be true of artistic sculpture or decorative ornamentation or embellishment added to a structure. On the other hand, where the only elements of shape in an architectural design are conceptually inseparable from the utilitarian aspects of the structure, copyright protection for the design would not be available.The Committee ha", "s considered, but chosen to defer, the possibility of protecting the design of typefaces. A \u201ctypeface\u201d can be defined as a set of letters, numbers, or other symbolic characters, whose forms are related by repeating design elements consistently applied in a notational system and are intended to be embodied in articles whose intrinsic utilitarian function is for use in composing text or other cognizable combinations of characters. The Committee does not regard the design of typeface, as thus defined, to be a copyrightable \u201cpictorial, graphic, or sculptural work\u201d within the meaning of this bill and the application of the dividing line in section 101.Enactment of Public Law 92\u2013140Pub. L. 92\u2013140Oct. 15, 197185 Stat. 391As a class of subject matter, sound recordings are clearly within the scope of the \u201cwritings of an author\u201d capable of protection under the Constitution [Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u202f8, cl. 8], and the extension of limited statutory protection to them was too long delayed. Aside from cases in which sounds are fixed by some purely mechanical means without originality of any kind, the copyright protection that would prevent the reproduction and distribution of unauthorized phonorecords of sound recordings is clearly justified.The copyrightable elements in a sound recording will usually, though not always, involve \u201cauthorship\u201d both on the part of the performers whose performance is captured and on the part of the record pro\u00adducer responsible for setting up the recording session, capturing and electronically processing the sounds, and compiling and editing them to make the final sound recording. There may, however, be cases where the record producer\u2019s contribution is so minimal that the performance is the only copyrightable element in the work, and there may be cases (for example, recordings of birdcalls, sounds of racing cars, et cetera) where only the record producer\u2019s contribution is copy\u00adrightable.Sound tracks of motion pictures, long a nebulous area in American copyright law, are specifically included in the defini", "tion of \u201cmotion pictures,\u201d and excluded in the definition of \u201csound recordings.\u201d To be a \u201cmotion picture,\u201d as defined, requires three elements: (1) a series of images, (2) the capability of showing the images in certain successive order, and (3) an impression of motion when the images are thus shown. Coupled with the basic requirements of original authorship and fixation in tangible form, this definition encompasses a wide range of cinematographic works embodied in films, tapes, video disks, and other media. However, it would not include: (1) unauthorized fixations of live performances or telecasts, (2) live telecasts that are not fixed simultaneously with their transmission, or (3) filmstrips and slide sets which, although consisting of a series of images intended to be shown in succession, are not capable of conveying an impression of motion.On the other hand, the bill equates audiovisual materials such as filmstrips, slide sets, and sets of trans\u00adparencies with \u201cmotion pictures\u201d rather than with \u201cpictorial, graphic, and sculptural works.\u201d Their sequential showing is closer to a \u201cperformance\u201d than to a \u201cdisplay,\u201d and the definition of \u201caudiovisual works,\u201d which applies also to \u201cmotion pictures,\u201d embraces works consisting of a series of related images that are by their nature, intended for showing by means of projectors or other devices.Nature of Copyright.Some concern has been expressed lest copyright in computer programs should extend protection to the methodology or processes adopted by the programmer, rather than merely to the \u201cwriting\u201d expressing his ideas. Section 102(b) is intended, among other things, to make clear that the expression adopted by the programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are not within the scope of the copyright law.Section 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to restate, in the context of the new single Federal system of copyr", "ight, that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.Editorial NotesAmendments1990\u2014Subsec.

L. 101\u2013650section 101 of this title \u00a7\u202f103. Subject matter of copyright: Compilations and derivative works(a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102 includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.(b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material.(Pub. L. 94\u2013553, title I, \u00a7\u202f101Oct. 19, 197690 Stat. 2545\nHistorical and Revision Noteshouse report no. 94\u20131476Section 103 complements section 102: A compilation or derivative work is copyrightable if it represents an \u201coriginal work of authorship\u201d and falls within one or more of the categories listed in section 102. Read together, the two sections make plain that the criteria of copyrightable subject matter stated in section 102 apply with full force to works that are entirely original and to those containing preexisting material. Section 103(b) is also intended to define, more sharply and clearly than does section 7 of the present law [section 7 of former title 17], the important interrelationship and correlation between protection of preexisting and of \u201cnew\u201d material in a particular work. The most important point here is one that is commonly misunderstood today: copyright in a \u201cnew version\u201d covers only the mate", "rial added by the later author, and has no effect one way or the other on the copyright or public domain status of the preexisting material.Between them the terms \u201ccompilations\u201d and \u201cderivative works\u201d which are defined in section 101 comprehend every copyrightable work that employs preexisting material or data of any kind. There is necessarily some overlapping between the two, but they basically represent different concepts. A \u201ccompilation\u201d results from a process of selecting, bringing together, organizing, and arranging previously existing material of all kinds, regardless of whether the individual items in the material have been or ever could have been subject to copyright. A \u201cderivative work,\u201d on the other hand, requires a process of recasting, transforming, or adapting \u201cone or more preexisting works\u201d; the \u201cpreexisting work\u201d must come within the general subject matter of copyright set forth in section 102, regardless of whether it is or was ever copyrighted.The second part of the sentence that makes up section 103(a) deals with the status of a compilation or derivative work unlawfully employing preexisting copyrighted material. In providing that protection does not extend to \u201cany part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully,\u201d the bill prevents an infringer from benefiting, through copyright protection, from committing an unlawful act, but preserves protection for those parts of the work that do not employ the preexisting work. Thus, an unauthorized translation of a novel could not be copyrighted at all, but the owner of copyright in an anthology of poetry could sue someone who infringed the whole anthology, even though the infringer proves that publication of one of the poems was unauthorized. Under this provision, copyright could be obtained as long as the use of the preexisting work was not \u201cunlawful,\u201d even though the consent of the copyright owner had not been obtained. For instance, the unauthorized reproduction of a work might be \u201clawful\u201d under the doctrine of fair use or an applicable", " foreign law, and if so the work incorporating it could be copyrighted. \u00a7\u202f104. Subject matter of copyright: National origin(a) Unpublished WorksThe works specified by sections 102 and 103, while unpublished, are subject to protection under this title without regard to the nationality or domicile of the author.(b) Published WorksThe works specified by sections 102 and 103, when published, are subject to protection under this title if\u2014(1) on the date of first publication, one or more of the authors is a national or domiciliary of the United States, or is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a treaty party, or is a stateless person, wherever that person may be domiciled; or(2) the work is first published in the United States or in a foreign nation that, on the date of first publication, is a treaty party; or(3) the work is a sound recording that was first fixed in a treaty party; or(4) the work is a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that is incorporated in a building or other structure, or an architectural work that is embodied in a building and the building or structure is located in the United States or a treaty party; or(5) the work is first published by the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies, or by the Organization of American States; or(6) the work comes within the scope of a Presidential proclamation. Whenever the President finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States or to works that are first published in the United States, copyright protection on substantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation extends protection to works of its own nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in that nation, the President may by proclamation extend protection under this title to works of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that nation, or which was first published in that nation. The President may revis", "e, suspend, or revoke any such proclamation or impose any conditions or limitations on protection under a proclamation.For purposes of paragraph (2), a work that is published in the United States or a treaty party within 30 days after publication in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party shall be considered to be first published in the United States or such treaty party, as the case may be.(c) Effect of Berne ConventionNo right or interest in a work eligible for protection under this title may be claimed by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the provisions of the Berne Convention, or the adherence of the United States thereto. Any rights in a work eligible for protection under this title that derive from this title, other Federal or State statutes, or the common law, shall not be expanded or reduced by virtue of, or in reliance upon, the provisions of the Berne Convention, or the adherence of the United States thereto.(d) Effect of Phonograms TreatiesNotwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b), no works other than sound recordings shall be eligible for protection under this title solely by virtue of the adherence of the United States to the Geneva Phonograms Convention or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.(Pub.

Subsection (a) imposes no qualifications of nationality and domicile with respect to unpublished works. Subsection (b) would make published works subject to protection under any one of four conditions:(1) The author is a national or domiciliary of the United States or of a country with which the United Stat", "es has copyright relations under a treaty, or is a stateless person;(2) The work is first published in the United States or in a country that is a party to the Universal Copyright Convention;(3) The work is first published by the United Nations, by any of its specialized agencies, or by the Organization of American States; or(4) The work is covered by a Presidential proclamation extending protection to works originating in a specified country which extends protection to U.S. works \u201con substantially the same basis\u201d as to its own works.The third of these conditions represents a treaty obligation of the United States. Under the Second Protocol of the Universal Copyright Convention, protection under U.S. Copyright law is expressly required for works published by the United Nations, by U.N. specialized agencies and by the Organization of American States.Editorial NotesAmendments1998\u2014Subsec.

Although the wording of the definition of \u201cwork of the United States Government\u201d differs somewhat from that of the definition of \u201cwork made for hire,\u201d the concepts are intended to be construed in the same way.A more difficult and far-reaching problem is whether the definition should be broadened to prohibit copyright in works prepared under U.S. Government contract or grant. As the bill is written, the Government agency concerned could determine in each case whether to allow an independent contractor or grantee, to secure copyright in works prepared in whole or in part with the use of Government funds. The argument that has been made against allowing copyright in this situation is that the public should not be required to pay a \u201cdouble subsidy,\u201d and th", "at it is inconsistent to prohibit copyright in works by Government employees while permitting private copyrights in a growing body of works created by persons who are paid with Government funds. Those arguing in favor of potential copyright protection have stressed the importance of copyright as an incentive to creation and dissemination in this situation, and the basically different policy considerations, applicable to works written by Government employees and those applicable to works prepared by private organizations with the use of Federal funds.The bill deliberately avoids making any sort of outright, unqualified prohibition against copyright in works prepared under Government contract or grant. There may well be cases where it would be in the public interest to deny copyright in the writings generated by Government research contracts and the like; it can be assumed that, where a Government agency commissions a work for its own use merely as an alternative to having one of its own employees prepare the work, the right to secure a private copyright would be withheld. However, there are almost certainly many other cases where the denial of copyright protection would be unfair or would hamper the production and publication of important works. Where, under the particular circumstances, Congress or the agency involved finds that the need to have a work freely available outweighs the need of the private author to secure copyright, the problem can be dealt with by specific legislation, agency regulations, or contractual restrictions.The prohibition on copyright protection for United States Government works is not intended to have any effect on protection of these works abroad. Works of the governments of most other countries are copyrighted. There are no valid policy reasons for denying such protection to United States Government works in foreign countries, or for precluding the Government from making licenses for the use of its works abroad.The effect of section 105 is intended to place all works of the United Sta", "tes Government, published or unpublished, in the public domain. This means that the individual Government official or employee who wrote the work could not secure copyright in it or restrain its dissemination by the Government or anyone else, but it also means that, as far as the copyright law is concerned, the Government could not restrain the employee or official from disseminating the work if he or she chooses to do so. The use of the term \u201cwork of the United States Government\u201d does not mean that a work falling within the definition of that term is the property of the U.S. Government.limited exception for national technical information serviceAt the House hearings in 1975 the U.S. Department of Commerce called attention to its National Technical Information Service (NTIS), which has a statutory mandate, under Chapter 23 [\u00a7\u202f1151 et seq.] of Title 15 of the U.S. Code, to operate a clearinghouse for the collection and dissemination of scientific, technical and engineering information. Under its statute, NTIS is required to be as self-sustaining as possible, and not to force the general public to bear publishing costs that are for private benefit. The Department urged an amendment to section 105 that would allow it to secure copyright in NTIS publications both in the United States and abroad, noting that a precedent exists in the Standard Reference Data Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f290(e) [\u00a7\u202f290e]).In response to this request the Committee adopted a limited exception to the general prohibition in section 105, permitting the Secretary of Commerce to \u201csecure copyright for a limited term not to exceed five years, on behalf of the United States as author or copyright owner\u201d in any NTIS publication disseminated pursuant to 15 U.S.C. Chapter 23 [\u00a7\u202f1151 et seq.]. In order to \u201csecure copyright\u201d in a work under this amendment the Secretary would be required to publish the work with a copyright notice, and the five-year term would begin upon the date of first publication.Proposed Saving Clause.Retention of a saving clause has been urge", "d on the ground that the present statutory provision is frequently cited, and that having the provision expressly stated in the law would avoid questions and explanations. The committee here observes: (1) there is nothing in section 105 that would relieve the Government of its obligation to secure permission in order to publish a copyrighted work; and (2) publication or other use by the Government of a private work would not affect its copyright protection in any way. The question of use of copyrighted material in documents published by the Congress and its Committees is discussed below in connection with section 107.Works of the United States Postal Service.Pub.

Thus, everything in section 106 is made \u201csubject to sections 107 through 118\u201d, and must be read in conjunction with those provisions.The exclusive rights accorded to a copyright owner under section 106 are \u201cto do and to authorize\u201d any of the activities specified in the five numbered clauses. Use of the phrase \u201cto authorize\u201d is intended to avoid any questions as to the liability of contributory infringers. For example, a person who lawfully acquires an authorized copy of a motion picture would be an infringer if he or she engages in the business of renting it to others for purposes of unauthorized public performance.Rights of Reproduction, Adaptation, and Publication.Reproduction\u201cReproduction\u201d under clause (1) of section 106 is to be distinguished from \u201cdisplay\u201d under clause (5). For a work to be \u201creproduced,\u201d its fixation in tangible form must be \u201csufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\u201d Thus, the showing of images on a screen or tube would not be a violation of clause (1), although it might come within the scope of clause (5).Pre", "paration of Derivative WorksTo be an infringement the \u201cderivative work\u201d must be \u201cbased upon the copyrighted work,\u201d and the definition in section 101 refers to \u201ca translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.\u201d Thus, to constitute a violation of section 106(2), the infringing work must incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some form; for example, a detailed commentary on a work or a programmatic musical composition inspired by a novel would not normally constitute infringements under this clause.Use in Information Storage and Retrieval SystemsPublic DistributionRights of Public Performance and Display. Performing Rights and the \u201cFor Profit\u201d LimitationThis approach is more reasonable than the outright exemption of the 1909 statute. The line between commercial and \u201cnonprofit\u201d organizations is increasingly difficult to draw. Many \u201cnon-profit\u201d organizations are highly subsidized and capable of paying royalties, and the widespread public exploitation of copyrighted works by public broadcasters and other noncommercial organizations is likely to grow. In addition to these trends, it is worth noting that performances and displays are continuing to supplant markets for printed copies and that in the future a broad \u201cnot for profit\u201d exemption could not only hurt authors but could dry up their incentive to write.The exclusive right of public performance is expanded to include not only motion pictures, including works recorded on film, video tape, and video disks, but also audiovisual works such as filmstrips and sets of slides. This provision of section 106(4), which is consistent with the assimilation of motion pictures to audiovisual works throughout the bill, is also related to amendments of the definitions of \u201cdisplay\u201d and \u201cperform\u201d discussed below. The important issue of performing rights in sound recordings is discussed in connection", " with section 114.Right of Public DisplayDefinitions.To \u201cperform\u201d a work, under the definition in section 101, includes reading a literary work aloud, singing or playing music, dancing a ballet or other choreographic work, and acting out a dramatic work or pantomime. A performance may be accomplished \u201ceither directly or by means of any device or process,\u201d including all kinds of equipment for reproducing or amplifying sounds or visual images, any sort of transmitting apparatus, any type of electronic retrieval system, and any other techniques and systems not yet in use or even\u00ad invented.The definition of \u201cperform\u201d in relation to \u201ca motion picture or other audiovisual work\u201d is \u201cto show its images in any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\u201d The showing of portions of a motion picture, filmstrip, or slide set must therefore be sequential to constitute a \u201cperformance\u201d rather than a \u201cdisplay\u201d, but no particular order need be maintained. The purely aural performance of a motion picture sound track, or of the sound portions of an audiovisual work, would constitute a performance of the \u201cmotion picture or other audiovisual work\u201d; but, where some of the sounds have been reproduced separately on phonorecords, a performance from the phonorecord would not constitute performance of the motion picture or audiovisual work.The corresponding definition of \u201cdisplay\u201d covers any showing of a \u201ccopy\u201d of the work, \u201ceither directly or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or process.\u201d Since \u201ccopies\u201d are defined as including the material object \u201cin which the work is first fixed,\u201d the right of public display applies to original works of art as well as to reproductions of them. With respect to motion pictures and other audiovisual works, it is a \u201cdisplay\u201d (rather than a \u201cperformance\u201d) to show their \u201cindividual images nonsequentially.\u201d In addition to the direct showings of a copy of a work, \u201cdisplay\u201d would include the projection of an image on a screen or other surface by any method, the transmis", "sion of an image by electronic or other means, and the showing of an image on a cathode ray tube, or similar viewing apparatus connected with any sort of information storage and retrieval system.Under clause (1) of the definition of \u201cpublicly\u201d in section 101, a performance or display is \u201cpublic\u201d if it takes place \u201cat a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered.\u201d One of the principal purposes of the definition was to make clear that, contrary to the decision in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distributing Corp. v. WyattClause (2) of the definition of \u201cpublicly\u201d in section 101 makes clear that the concepts of public performance and public display include not only performances and displays that occur initially in a public place, but also acts that transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to the public by means of any device or process. The definition of \u201ctransmit\u201d\u2014to communicate a performance or display \u201cby any device or process whereby images or sound are received beyond the place from which they are sent\u201d\u2014is broad enough to include all conceivable forms and combinations of wired or wireless communications media, including but by no means limited to radio and television broadcasting as we know them. Each and every method by which the images or sounds comprising a performance or display are picked up and conveyed is a \u201ctransmission,\u201d and if the transmission reaches the public in my [any] form, the case comes within the scope of clauses (4) or (5) of section 106.Under the bill, as under the present law, a performance made available by transmission to the public at large is \u201cpublic\u201d even though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even if there is no proof that any of the potential recipients was operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission. The same principles apply whenever the potential recipients of the transmission represent a limited segment", " of the public, such as the occupants of hotel rooms or the subscribers of a cable television service. Clause (2) of the definition of \u201cpublicly\u201d is applicable \u201cwhether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\u201dEditorial NotesAmendments2002\u2014Pub.

Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair useNotwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the ", "factors to be considered shall include\u2014(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.(Pub.

L. 102\u2013492Oct. 24, 1992106 Stat. 3145\nHistorical and Revision Noteshouse report no. 94\u20131476General Background of the Problem.\u201cquotation of excerpts in a review or criticism for purposes of illustration or comment; quotation of short passages in a scholarly or technical work, for illustration or clarification of the author\u2019s observations; use in a parody of some of the content of the work parodied; summary of an address or article, with brief quotations, in a news report; reproduction by a library of a portion of a work to replace part of a damaged copy; reproduction by a teacher or student of a small part of a work to illustrate a lesson; reproduction of a work in legislative or judicial proceedings or reports; incidental and fortuitous reproduction, in a newsreel or broadcast, of a work located in the scene of an event being reported.\u201dAlthough the courts have considered and ruled upon the fair use doctrine over and over again, no real definition of the concept has ever emerged. Indeed, since the doctrine is an equitable rule of reason, no generally applicable definition is possible, and each case raising the question must be decided on its own facts. On the other hand, the courts have evolved a set of criteria which, though in no case definitive or determinative, provide some gauge for balancing the equities. These criteria have been stated in variou", "s ways, but essentially they can all be reduced to the four standards which have been adopted in section 107: \u201c(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\u201dThese criteria are relevant in determining whether the basic doctrine of fair use, as stated in the first sentence of section 107, applies in a particular case: \u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 106, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.\u201dThe specific wording of section 107 as it now stands is the result of a process of accretion, resulting from the long controversy over the related problems of fair use and the reproduction (mostly by photocopying) of copyrighted material for educational and scholarly purposes. For example, the reference to fair use \u201cby reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means\u201d is mainly intended to make clear that the doctrine has as much application to photocopying and taping as to older forms of use; it is not intended to give these kinds of reproduction any special status under the fair use provision or to sanction any reproduction beyond the normal and reasonable limits of fair use. Similarly, the newly-added reference to \u201cmultiple copies for classroom use\u201d is a recognition that, under the proper circumstances of fairness, the doctrine can be applied to reproductions of multiple copies for the members of a class.The Committee has amended the first of the criteria to be considered\u2014\u201cthe purpose and character of t", "he use\u201d\u2014to state explicitly that this factor includes a consideration of \u201cwhether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non-profit educational purposes.\u201d This amendment is not intended to be interpreted as any sort of not-for-profit limitation on educational uses of copyrighted works. It is an express recognition that, as under the present law, the commercial or non-profit character of an activity, while not conclusive with respect to fair use, can and should be weighed along with other factors in fair use decisions.General Intention Behind the Provision.Intention as to Classroom Reproduction.The Committee also adheres to its earlier conclusion, that \u201ca specific exemption freeing certain reproductions of copyrighted works for educational and scholarly purposes from copyright control is not justified.\u201d At the same time the Committee recognizes, as it did in 1967, that there is a \u201cneed for greater certainty and protection for teachers.\u201d In an effort to meet this need the Committee has not only adopted further amendments to section 107, but has also amended section 504(c) to provide innocent teachers and other non-profit users of copyrighted material with broad insulation against unwarranted liability for infringement. The latter amendments are discussed below in connection with Chapter 5 of the bill [\u00a7\u202f501 et seq. of this title].In 1967 the Committee also sought to approach this problem by including, in its report, a very thorough discussion of \u201cthe considerations lying behind the four criteria listed in the amended section 107, in the context of typical classroom situations arising today.\u201d This discussion appeared on pp. 32\u201335 of the 1967 report, and with some changes has been retained in the Senate report on S. 22 (S. Rep. No. 94\u2013473, pp. 63\u201365). The Committee has reviewed this discussion, and considers that it still has value as an analysis of various aspects of the problem.At the Judiciary Subcommittee hearings in June 1975, Chairman Kastenmeier and other members urged the parties to meet together indepe", "ndently in an effort to achieve a meeting of the minds as to permissible educational uses of copyrighted material. The response to these suggestions was positive, and a number of meetings of three groups, dealing respectively with classroom reproduction of printed material, music, and audio-visual material, were held beginning in September 1975.In a joint letter to Chairman Kastenmeier, dated March 19, 1976You may remember that in our letter of March 8, 1976section 504 of this titleMarch 3, 1976We are now happy to tell you that the agreement has been approved by the principals and we enclose a copy herewith. We had originally intended to translate the agreement into language suitable for inclusion in the legislative report dealing with Section 107 [this section], but we have since been advised by committee staff that this will not be necessary.As stated above, the agreement refers only to copying from books and periodicals, and it is not intended to apply to musical or audiovisual works.The full text of the agreement is as follows:Agreement on Guidelines for Classroom Copying in Not-For-Profit Educational Institutionswith respect to books and periodicalsThe purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of educational fair use under Section 107 of H.R. 2223 [this section]. The parties agree that the conditions determining the extent of permissible copying for educational purposes may change in the future; that certain types of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be permissible in the future; and conversely that in the future other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may be permissible under revised guidelines.Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended to limit the types of copying permitted under the standards of fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section 107 of the Copyright Revision Bill [this section]. There may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the guidelines stated below", " may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use.guidelinesI.

Hoffman.\u2001Chairman, Copyright Committee.In a joint letter dated April 30, 1976During the hearings on H.R. 2223 in June 1975, you and several of your subcommittee members suggested that concerned groups should work together in developing guidelines which would be helpful to clarify Section 107 of the bill [this section].Representatives of music educators and music publishers delayed their meetings until guidelines had been developed relative to books and periodicals. Shortly after that work was completed and those guidelines were forwarded to your subcommittee, representatives of the undersigned music organizations met together with representatives of the Ad Hoc Committee on Copyright Law Revision to draft guidelines relative to music.We are very pleased to inform you that the discussions thus have been fruitful on the guidelines which have been developed. Since private music teachers are an important factor in music education, due consideration has been given to the concerns of that group.We trust that this will be helpful in the report on the bill to clarify Fair Use as it applies to music.The text of the guidelines accompanying this letter is as follows:guidelines for educational uses of musicThe purpose of the following guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of educational fair use under Section 107 of H.R. 2223 [this section]. The parties agree that the conditions determining the extent of permissible copying for educational purposes may change in the future; that certain types of copying permitted under these guidelines may not be permissible in the future, a", "nd conversely that in the future other types of copying not permitted under these guidelines may be permissible under revised guidelines.Moreover, the following statement of guidelines is not intended to limit the types of copying permitted under the standards of fair use under judicial decision and which are stated in Section 107 of the Copyright Revision Bill [this section]. There may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the guidelines stated below may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use.A. Permissible Uses1. Emergency copying to replace purchased copies which for any reason are not available for an imminent performance provided purchased replacement copies shall be substituted in due course.2. (a) For academic purposes other than performance, multiple copies of excerpts of works may be made, provided that the excerpts do not comprise a part of the whole which would constitute a performable unit such as a section, movement or aria, but in no case more than 10% of the whole work. The number of copies shall not exceed one copy per pupil.(b) For academic purposes other than performance, a single copy of an entire performable unit (section, movement, aria, etc.) that is, (1) confirmed by the copyright proprietor to be out of print or (2) unavailable except in a larger work, may be made by or for a teacher solely for the purpose of his or her scholarly research or in preparation to teach a class.3. Printed copies which have been purchased may be edited or simplified provided that the fundamental character of the work is not distorted or the lyrics, if any, altered or lyrics added if none exist.4. A single copy of recordings of performances by students may be made for evaluation or rehearsal purposes and may be retained by the educational institution or individual teacher.5. A single copy of a sound recording (such as a tape, disc or cassette) of copyrighted music may be made from sound recordings owned by an educational institution or an individual teacher for the purpose of c", "onstructing aural exercises or examinations and may be retained by the educational institution or individual teacher. (This pertains only to the copyright of the music itself and not to any copyright which may exist in the sound recording.)B. Prohibitions1. Copying to create or replace or substitute for anthologies, compilations or collective works.2. Copying of or from works intended to be \u201cconsumable\u201d in the course of study or of teaching such as workbooks, exercises, standardized tests and answer sheets and like material.3. Copying for the purpose of performance, except as in A(1) above.4. Copying for the purpose of substituting for the purchase of music, except as in A(1) and A(2) above.5. Copying without inclusion of the copyright notice which appears on the printed copy.The problem of off-the-air taping for nonprofit classroom use of copyrighted audiovisual works incorporated in radio and television broadcasts has proved to be difficult to resolve. The Committee believes that the fair use doctrine has some limited application in this area, but it appears that the development of detailed guidelines will require a more thorough exploration than has so far been possible of the needs and problems of a number of different interests affected, and of the various legal problems presented. Nothing in section 107 or elsewhere in the bill is intended to change or prejudge the law on the point. On the other hand, the Committee is sensitive to the importance of the problem, and urges the representatives of the various interests, if possible under the leadership of the Register of Copyrights, to continue their discussions actively and in a constructive spirit. If it would be helpful to a solution, the Committee is receptive to undertaking further consideration of the problem in a future Congress.The Committee appreciates and commends the efforts and the cooperative and reasonable spirit of the parties who achieved the agreed guidelines on books and periodicals and on music. Representatives of the American Association of ", "University Professors and of the Association of American Law Schools have written to the Committee strongly criticizing the guidelines, particularly with respect to multiple copying, as being too restrictive with respect to classroom situations at the university and graduate level. However, the Committee notes that the Ad Hoc group did include representatives of higher education, that the stated \u201cpurpose of the *\u2000*\u2000* guidelines is to state the minimum and not the maximum standards of educational fair use\u201d and that the agreement acknowledges \u201cthere may be instances in which copying which does not fall within the guidelines *\u2000*\u2000* may nonetheless be permitted under the criteria of fair use.\u201dThe Committee believes the guidelines are a reasonable interpretation of the minimum standards of fair use. Teachers will know that copying within the guidelines is fair use. Thus, the guidelines serve the purpose of fulfilling the need for greater certainty and protection for teachers. The Committee expresses the hope that if there are areas where standards other than these guidelines may be appropriate, the parties will continue their efforts to provide additional specific guidelines in the same spirit of good will and give and take that has marked the discussion of this subject in recent months.Reproduction and Uses for Other Purposes.The fair use doctrine would be relevant to the use of excerpts from copyrighted works in educational broadcasting activities not exempted under section 110(2) or 112, and not covered by the licensing provisions of section 118. In these cases the factors to be weighed in applying the criteria of this section would include whether the performers, producers, directors, and others responsible for the broadcast were paid, the size and nature of the audience, the size and number of excerpts taken and, in the case of recordings made for broadcast, the number of copies reproduced and the extent of their reuse or exchange. The availability of the fair use doctrine to educational broadcasters would be narr", "owly circumscribed in the case of motion pictures and other audiovisual works, but under appropriate circumstances it could apply to the nonsequential showing of an individual still or slide, or to the performance of a short excerpt from a motion picture for criticism or comment.Another special instance illustrating the application of the fair use doctrine pertains to the making of copies or phonorecords of works in the special forms needed for the use of blind persons. These special forms, such as copies in Braille and phonorecords of oral readings (talking books), are not usually made by the publishers for commercial distribution. For the most part, such copies and phonorecords are made by the Library of Congress\u2019 Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped with permission obtained from the copyright owners, and are circulated to blind persons through regional libraries covering the nation. In addition, such copies and phonorecords are made locally by individual volunteers for the use of blind persons in their communities, and the Library of Congress conducts a program for training such volunteers. While the making of multiple copies or phonorecords of a work for general circulation requires the permission of the copyright owner, a problem addressed in section 710 of the bill, the making of a single copy or phonorecord by an individual as a free service for blind persons would properly be considered a fair use under section 107.A problem of particular urgency is that of preserving for posterity prints of motion pictures made before 1942. Aside from the deplorable fact that in a great many cases the only existing copy of a film has been deliberately destroyed, those that remain are in immediate danger of disintegration; they were printed on film stock with a nitrate base that will inevitably decompose in time. The efforts of the Library of Congress, the American Film Institute, and other organizations to rescue and preserve this irreplaceable contribution to our cultural life are to be applauded, and the m", "aking of duplicate copies for purposes of archival preservation certainly falls within the scope of \u201cfair use.\u201dWhen a copyrighted work contains unfair, inaccurate, or derogatory information concerning an individual or institution, the individual or institution may copy and reproduce such parts of the work as are necessary to permit understandable comment on the statements made in the work.The Committee has considered the question of publication, in Congressional hearings and documents, of copyrighted material. Where the length of the work or excerpt published and the number of copies authorized are reasonable under the circumstances, and the work itself is directly relevant to a matter of legitimate legislative concern, the Committee believes that the publication would constitute fair use.During the consideration of the revision bill in the 94th Congress it was proposed that independent newsletters, as distinguished from house organs and publicity or advertising publications, be given separate treatment. It is argued that newsletters are particularly vulnerable to mass photocopying, and that most newsletters have fairly modest circulations. Whether the copying of portions of a newsletter is an act of infringement or a fair use will necessarily turn on the facts of the individual case. However, as a general principle, it seems clear that the scope of the fair use doctrine should be considerably narrower in the case of newsletters than in that of either mass-circulation periodicals or scientific journals. The commercial nature of the user is a significant factor in such cases: Copying by a profit-making user of even a small portion of a newsletter may have a significant impact on the commercial market for the work.The Committee has examined the use of excerpts from copyrighted works in the art work of calligraphers. The committee believes that a single copy reproduction of an excerpt from a copyrighted work by a calligrapher for a single client does not represent an infringement of copyright. Likewise, a single rep", "roduction of excerpts from a copyrighted work by a student calligrapher or teacher in a learning situation would be a fair use of the copyrighted work.The Register of Copyrights has recommended that the committee report describe the relationship between this section and the provisions of section 108 relating to reproduction by libraries and archives. The doctrine of fair use applies to library photocopying, and nothing contained in section 108 \u201cin any way affects the right of fair use.\u201d No provision of section 108 is intended to take away any rights existing under the fair use doctrine. To the contrary, section 108 authorizes certain photocopying practices which may not qualify as a fair use.The criteria of fair use are necessarily set forth in general terms. In the application of the criteria of fair use to specific photocopying practices of libraries, it is the intent of this legislation to provide an appropriate balancing of the rights of creators, and the needs of users.Editorial NotesAmendments1992\u2014Pub.

Similarly, it would not be possible for a non-profit institution, by means of contractual arrangements with a commercial copying enterprise, to authorize the enterprise to carry out copying and distribution functions that would be exempt if conducted by the non-profit institution itself.The reference to \u201cindirect commercial advantage\u201d has raised questions as to the status of photocopying done by or for libraries or archival collections within industrial, profit-making, or proprietary institutions (such as the research and development departments of chemical, pharmaceutical, automobile, and oil corporations, the library of a proprietary hospital, the collections owned by a law or medical partnership, etc.).There is a direct interrelationship between this problem and the prohibitions against \u201cmultiple\u201d and \u201csystematic\u201d photocopying in section 108(g)(1) and (2). Under section 108, a library in a profitmaking organization would not be authorized to:(a) use a single subscription or copy to supply its employees with multiple copies of material relevant to their work; or(b) use a single subscription or copy to supply its employees, on request, with single copies of material relevant to their work, where the arrangement is \u2018\u2019systematic\u201d in the sense of deliberately substituting photocopying for subscription or purchase; or(c) use \u201cinterlibrary loan\u201d arrangements for obtaining photocopies in such aggregate quantities as to substitute for subscriptions or purchase of material needed by employees in their work.Moreover, a library in a profit-making organization could not evade these obligations by installing reproducing equipment on its premises for unsupervised use by the organization\u2019s staff.Isolated, s", "pontaneous making of single photocopies by a library in a for-profit organization, without any systematic effort to substitute photocopying for subscriptions or purchases, would be covered by section 108, even though the copies are furnished to the employees of the organization for use in their work. Similarly, for-profit libraries could participate in interlibrary arrangements for exchange of photocopies, as long as the reproduction or distribution was not \u201csystematic.\u201d These activities, by themselves, would ordinarily not be considered \u201cfor direct or indirect commercial advantage,\u201d since the \u201cadvantage\u201d referred to in this clause must attach to the immediate commercial motivation behind the reproduction or distribution itself, rather than to the ultimate profit-making motivation behind the enterprise in which the library is located. On the other hand, section 108 would not excuse reproduction or distribution if there were a commercial motive behind the actual making or distributing of the copies, if multiple copies were made or distributed, or if the photocopying activities were \u201csystematic\u201d in the sense that their aim was to substitute for subscriptions or purchases.The rights of reproduction and distribution under section 108 apply in the following circumstances:Archival Reproduction.Replacement of Damaged Copy.Articles and Small Excerpts.Out-of-Print Works.General Exemptions.Clause (3) provides that nothing in section 108 is intended to limit the reproduction and distribution by lending of a limited number of copies and excerpts of an audiovisual news program. This exemption is intended to apply to the daily newscasts of the national television networks, which report the major events of the day. It does not apply to documentary (except documentary programs involving news reporting as that term is used in section 107), magazine-format or other public affairs broadcasts dealing with subjects of general interest to the viewing public.The clause was first added to the revision bill in 1974 by the adoption of an ", "amendment proposed by Senator Baker. It is intended to permit libraries and archives, subject to the general conditions of this section, to make off-the-air videotape recordings of daily network news casts for limited distribution to scholars and researchers for use in research purposes. As such, it is an adjunct to the American Television and Radio Archive established in Section 113 of the Act [2 U.S.C. 170Clause (4), in addition to asserting that nothing contained in section 108 \u201caffects the right of fair use as provided by section 107\u201d, also provides that the right of reproduction granted by this section does not override any contractual arrangements assumed by a library or archives when it obtained a work for its collections: For example, if there is an express contractual prohibition against reproduction for any purpose, this legislation shall not be construed as justifying a violation of the contract. This clause is intended to encompass the situation where an individual makes papers, manuscripts or other works available to a library with the understanding that they will not be reproduced.It is the intent of this legislation that a subsequent unlawful use by a user of a copy or phonorecord of a work lawfully made by a library, shall not make the library liable for such improper use.Multiple Copies and Systematic Reproduction.With respect to material described in subsection (d)\u2014articles or other contributions to periodicals or collections, and small parts of other copyrighted works\u2014subsection (g)(2) provides that the exemptions of section 108 do not apply if the library or archive engages in \u201csystematic reproduction or distribution of single or multiple copies or phonorecords.\u201d This provision in S. 22 provoked a storm of controversy, centering around the extent to which the restrictions on \u201csystematic\u201d activities would prevent the continuation and development of interlibrary networks and other arrangements involving the exchange of photocopies. After thorough consideration, the Committee amended section 108(", "g)(2) to add the following proviso:ProvidedIn addition, the Committee added a new subsection (i) to section 108 [this section], requiring the Register of Copyrights, five years from the effective date of the new Act and at five-year intervals thereafter, to report to Congress upon \u201cthe extent to which this section has achieved the intended statutory balancing of the rights of creators, and the needs of users,\u201d and to make appropriate legislative or other recommendations. As noted in connection with section 107, the Committee also amended section 504(c) in a way that would insulate librarians from unwarranted liability for copyright infringement; this amendment is discussed below.The key phrases in the Committee\u2019s amendment of section 108(g)(2) are \u201caggregate quantities\u201d and \u201csubstitute for a subscription to or purchase of\u201d a work. To be implemented effectively in practice, these provisions will require the development and implementation of more-or-less specific guidelines establishing criteria to govern various situations.The National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) offered to provide good offices in helping to develop these guidelines. This offer was accepted and, although the final text of guidelines has not yet been achieved, the Committee has reason to hope that, within the next month, some agreement can be reached on an initial set of guidelines covering practices under section 108(g)(2).Works Excluded.Although subsection (h) generally removes musical, graphic, and audiovisual works from the specific exemptions of section 108, it is important to recognize that the doctrine of fair use under section 107 remains fully applicable to the photocopying or other reproduction of such works. In the case of music, for example, it would be fair use for a scholar doing musicological research to have a library supply a copy of a portion of a score or to reproduce portions of a phonorecord of a work. Nothing in section 108 impairs the applicability of the fair use doctrine to a wide varie", "ty of situations involving photocopying or other reproduction by a library of copyrighted material in its collections, where the user requests the reproduction for legitimate scholarly or research purposes.Editorial NotesAmendments2005\u2014Subsec.

Nothing in the preceding sentence shall apply to the rental, lease, or lending of a phonorecord for nonprofit purposes by a nonprofit library or nonprofit edu", "cational institution. The transfer of possession of a lawfully made copy of a computer program by a nonprofit educational institution to another nonprofit educational institution or to faculty, staff, and students does not constitute rental, lease, or lending for direct or indirect commercial purposes under this subsection.(B) This subsection does not apply to\u2014(i) a computer program which is embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied during the ordinary operation or use of the machine or product; or(ii) a computer program embodied in or used in conjunction with a limited purpose computer that is designed for playing video games and may be designed for other purposes.(C) Nothing in this subsection affects any provision of chapter 9 of this title.(2)(A) Nothing in this subsection shall apply to the lending of a computer program for nonprofit purposes by a nonprofit library, if each copy of a computer program which is lent by such library has affixed to the packaging containing the program a warning of copyright in accordance with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.(B) Not later than three years after the date of the enactment of the Computer Software Rental Amendments Act of 1990, and at such times thereafter as the Register of Copyrights considers appropriate, the Register of Copyrights, after consultation with representatives of copyright owners and librarians, shall submit to the Congress a report stating whether this paragraph has achieved its intended purpose of maintaining the integrity of the copyright system while providing nonprofit libraries the capability to fulfill their function.

A library that has acquired ownership of a copy is entitled to lend it under any conditions it chooses to impose. This does not mean that conditions on future disposition of copies or phonorecords, imposed by a contract between their buyer and seller, would be unenforceable between the parties as a breach of contract, but it does mean that they could not be enforced by an action for infringement of copyright. Under section 202 however, the owner of the physical copy or phonorecord cannot reproduce or perform the copyrighted work publicly without the copyright owner\u2019s consent.To come within the scope of section 109(a), a copy or phonorecord must have been \u201clawfully made under this title,\u201d though not necessarily with the copyright owner\u2019s authorization. For example, any resale of an illegally \u201cpirated\u201d phonorecord would be an infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions of section 115 would not.Effect on Display of Copy.Section 109(b) adopts the general principle that the lawful owner of a copy of a work should be able to put his copy on public display without the consent of the copyright owner. As in cases arising under section 109(a), this does not mean that contractual restrictions on display between a buyer and seller would be unenforceable as a matter of contract law.The exclusive right of public display granted by section 106(5) would not apply where the owner of a copy wishes to show it directly to the public, as in a gallery or display case, or indirectly, as through an opaque projector. Where the copy itself is intended for projection, as in the case of a photographic slide, negative, or transparency, the public projection of a single image would be permitted as long as the viewers are \u201cp", "resent at the place where the copy is located.\u201dOn the other hand, section 109(b) takes account of the potentialities of the new communications media, notably television, cable and optical transmission devices, and information storage and retrieval devices, for replacing printed copies with visual images. First of all, the public display of an image of a copyrighted work would not be exempted from copyright control if the copy from which the image was derived were outside the presence of the viewers. In other words, the display of a visual image of a copyrighted work would be an infringement if the image were transmitted by any method (by closed or open circuit television, for example, or by a computer system) from one place to members of the public located elsewhere.Moreover, the exemption would extend only to public displays that are made \u201ceither directly or by the projection of no more than one image at a time.\u201d Thus, even where the copy and the viewers are located at the same place, the simultaneous projection of multiple images of the work would not be exempted. For example, where each person in a lecture hall is supplied with a separate viewing apparatus, the copyright owner\u2019s permission would generally be required in order to project an image of a work on each individual screen at the same time.The committee\u2019s intention is to preserve the traditional privilege of the owner of a copy to display it directly, but to place reasonable restrictions on the ability to display it indirectly in such a way that the copyright owner\u2019s market for reproduction and distribution of copies would be affected. Unless it constitutes a fair use under section 107, or unless one of the special provisions of section 110 or 111 is applicable, projection of more than one image at a time, or transmission of an image to the public over television or other communication channels, would be an infringement for the same reasons that reproduction in copies would be. The concept of \u201cthe place where the copy is located\u201d is generally intended ", "to refer to a situation in which the viewers are present in the same physical surroundings as the copy, even though they cannot see the copy directly.Effect of Mere Possession of Copy or Phonorecord.Burden of Proof in Infringement Actions.American International Pictures, Inc. v.

Royalties payable to copyright owners for any public performance or display of their works other than such performances or displays as are exempted under paragraph (5) shall not be diminished in any respect as a result of such exemption.In paragraph (2), the term \u201cmediated instructional activities\u201d with respect to the performance or display of a work by digital transmission under this section refers to activities that use such work as an integral part of the class experience, controlled by or under the actual supervision of the instructor and analogous to the type of performance or display that would take place in a live classroom setting.

Clauses (1) and (2) between them are intended to cover all of the various methods by which perform\u00adances or displays in the course of systematic instruction take place.Face-to-Face Teaching Activities.There appears to be no need for a statutory definition of \u201cface-to-face\u201d teaching activities to clarify the scope of the provision. \u201cFace-to-face teaching activities\u201d under clause (1) embrace instructional perform\u00adances and displays that are not \u201ctransmitted.\u201d The concept does not require that the teacher and students be able to see each other, although it does require their simultaneous presence in the same general place. Use of the phrase \u201cin the course of face-to-face teaching activities\u201d is intended to exclude broadcasting or other transmissions from an outside location into classrooms, whether radio or television and whether open or closed circuit. However, as long as the instructor and pupils are in the same building or general area, the exemption would extend to the use of devices for amplifying or reproducing sound and for projecting visual images. The \u201cteaching activities\u201d exempted by the clause encompass systematic instruction of a very wide variety of subjects, but they do not include performances or displays, whatever their cultural value or intellectual appeal, that are given for the recreation or entertainment of any part of their audience.Works AffectedInstructors or PupilsNonprofit Educational InstitutionClassroom or Similar PlaceMotion Pictures and Other Audiovisual WorksProjection DevicesInstructional Broadcasting", ". Works AffectedSystematic Instructional ActivitiesContent of TransmissionIntended Recipients(i)(ii)(iii)In all three cases, the instructional transmission need only be made \u201cprimarily\u201d rather than \u201csolely\u201d to the specified recipients to be exempt. Thus, the transmission could still be exempt even though it is capable of reception by the public at large. Conversely, it would not be regarded as made \u201cprimarily\u201d for one of the required groups of recipients if the principal purpose behind the transmission is reception by the public at large, even if it is cast in the form of instruction and is also received in classrooms. Factors to consider in determining the \u201cprimary\u201d purpose of a program would include its subject matter, content, and the time of its transmission.Paragraph (i) of subclause (C) generally covers what are known as \u201cin-school\u201d broadcasts, whether open- or closed-circuit. The reference to \u201cclassrooms or similar places\u201d here is intended to have the same meaning as that of the phrase as used in section 110(1). The exemption in paragraph (ii) is intended to exempt transmissions providing systematic instruction to individuals who cannot be reached in classrooms because of \u201ctheir disabilities or other special circumstances.\u201d Accordingly, the exemption is confined to instructional broadcasting that is an adjunct to the actual classwork of nonprofit schools or is primarily for people who cannot be brought together in classrooms such as preschool children, displaced workers, illiterates, and shut-ins.There has been some question as to whether or not the language in this section of the bill is intended to include instructional television college credit courses. These telecourses are aimed at undergraduate and graduate students in earnest pursuit of higher educational degrees who are unable to attend daytime classes because of daytime employment, distance from campus, or some other intervening reason. So long as these broadcasts are aimed at regularly enrolled students and conducted by recognized higher educatio", "nal institutions, the committee believes that they are clearly within the language of section 110(2)(C)(ii). Like night school and correspondence courses before them, these telecourses are fast becoming a valuable adjunct of the normal college curriculum.The third exemption in subclause (C) is intended to permit the use of copyrighted material, in accordance with the other conditions of section 110(2), in the course of instructional transmissions for Government personnel who are receiving training \u201cas a part of their official duties or employment.\u201dReligious Services.The exemption, which to some extent has its counterpart in sections 1 and 104 of the present law [sections 1 and 104 of former title 17], applies to dramatico-musical works \u201cof a religious nature.\u201d The purpose here is to exempt certain performances of sacred music that might be regarded as \u201cdramatic\u201d in nature, such as oratorios, cantatas, musical settings of the mass, choral services, and the like. The exemption is not intended to cover performances of secular operas, musical plays, motion pictures, and the like, even if they have an underlying religious or philosophical theme and take place \u201cin the course of [religious] services.\u201dTo be exempted under section 110(3) a performance or display must be \u201cin the course of services,\u201d thus excluding activities at a place of worship that are for social, educational, fund raising, or entertainment purposes. Some performances of these kinds could be covered by the exemption in section 110(4), discussed next. Since the performance or display must also occur \u201cat a place of worship or other religious assembly,\u201d the exemption would not extend to religious broadcasts or other transmissions to the public at large, even where the transmissions were sent from the place of worship. On the other hand, as long as services are being conducted before a religious gathering, the exemption would apply if they were conducted in places such as auditoriums, outdoor theaters, and the like.Certain Other Nonprofit Performances.Scope", " of ExemptionNo Profit MotiveNo Payment for PerformanceAdmission ChargeUnder the second of these conditions, a performance meeting the other conditions of clause (4) would be exempt even if an admission fee is charged, provided any amounts left \u201cafter deducting the reasonable costs of producing the performance\u201d are used solely for bona fide educational, religious, or charitable purposes. In cases arising under this second condition and as provided in subclause (B), where there is an admission charge, the copyright owner is given an opportunity to decide whether and under what conditions the copyrighted work should be performed; otherwise, owners could be compelled to make involuntary donations to the fund-raising activities of causes to which they are opposed. The subclause would thus permit copyright owners to prevent public performances of their works under section 110(4)(B) by serving notice of objection, with the reasons therefor, at least seven days in advance.Mere Reception in Public.The basic rationale of this clause is that the secondary use of the transmission by turning on an ordinary receiver in public is so remote and minimal that no further liability should be imposed. In the vast majority of these cases no royalties are collected today, and the exemption should be made explicit in the statute. This clause has nothing to do with cable television systems and the exemptions would be denied in any case where the audience is charged directly to see or hear the transmission.With respect to section 110(5), the conference substitute conforms to the language in the Senate bill.

A typical system consists of a central antenna which receives and amplifies television signals and a network of cables through which the signals are transmitted to the receiving sets of individual subscribers. In", " addition to an installation charge, the subscribers pay a monthly charge for the basic service averaging about six dollars. A large number of these systems provide automated programing. A growing number of CATV systems also originate programs, such as movies and sports, and charge additional fees for this service (pay-cable).The number of cable systems has grown very rapidly since their introduction in 1950, and now total about 3,450 operating systems, servicing 7,700 communities. Systems currently in operation reach about 10.8 million homes. It is reported that the 1975 total subscriber revenues of the cable industry were approximately $770 million.Pursuant to two decisions of the Supreme Court (Fortnightly Corp. v. United Artist Television, IncTeleprompter Corp. v. CBS, IncThe difficult problem of determining the copyright liability of cable television systems has been before the Congress since 1965. In 1967, this Committee sought to address and resolve the issues in H.R. 2512, an early version of the general revision bill (see H.R. Rep. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.). However, largely because of the cable-copyright impasse, the bill died in the Senate.The history of the attempts to find a solution to the problem since 1967 has been explored thoroughly in the voluminous hearings and testimony on the general revision bill, and has also been succinctly summarized by the Register of Copyrights in her Second Supplementary Report, Chapter V.The Committee now has before it the Senate bill which contains a series of detailed and complex provisions which attempt to resolve the question of the copyright liability of cable television systems. After extensive consideration of the Senate bill, the arguments made during and after the hearings, and of the issues involved, this Committee has also concluded that there is no simple answer to the cable-copyright controversy. In particular, any statutory scheme that imposes copyright liability on cable television systems must take account of the intricate and complicated rules a", "nd regulations adopted by the Federal Communications Commission to govern the cable television industry. While the Committee has carefully avoided including in the bill any provisions which would interfere with the FCC\u2019s rules or which might be characterized as affecting \u201ccommunications policy\u201d, the Committee has been cognizant of the interplay between the copyright and the communications elements of the legislation.We would, therefore, caution the Federal Communications Commission, and others who make determinations concerning communications policy, not to rely upon any action of this Committee as a basis for any significant changes in the delicate balance of regulation in areas where the Congress has not resolved the issue. Specifically, we would urge the Federal Communications Commission to understand that it was not the intent of this bill to touch on issues such as pay cable regulation or increased use of imported distant signals. These matters are ones of communications policy and should be left to the appropriate committees in the Congress for resolution.In general, the Committee believes that cable systems are commercial enterprises whose basic retransmission operations are based on the carriage of copyrighted program material and that copyright royalties should be paid by cable operators to the creators of such programs. The Committee recognizes, however, that it would be impractical and unduly burdensome to require every cable system to negotiate with every copyright owner whose work was retransmitted by a cable system. Accordingly, the Committee has determined to maintain the basic principle of the Senate bill to establish a compulsory copyright license for the retransmission of those over-the-air broadcast signals that a cable system is authorized to carry pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC.The compulsory license is conditioned, however, on certain requirements and limitations. These include compliance with reporting requirements, payment of the royalty fees established in the bill, a ba", "n on the substitution or deletion of commercial advertising, and geographic limits on the compulsory license for copyrighted programs broadcast by Canadian or Mexican stations. Failure to comply with these requirements and limitations subjects a cable system to a suit for copyright infringement and the remedies provided under the bill for such actions.In setting a royalty fee schedule for the compulsory license, the Committee determined that the initial schedule should be established in the bill. It recognized, however, that adjustments to the schedule would be required from time to time. Accordingly, the Copyright Royalty Commission, established in chapter 8 [\u00a7\u202f801 et seq. of this title], is empowered to make the adjustments in the initial rates, at specified times, based on standards and conditions set forth in the bill.In setting an initial fee schedule, the Senate bill based the royalty fee on a sliding scale related to the gross receipts of a cable system for providing the basic retransmission service and rejected a statutory scheme that would distinguish between \u201clocal\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d signals. The Committee determined, however, that there was no evidence that the retransmission of \u201clocal\u201d broadcast signals by a cable operator threatens the existing market for copyright program owners. Similarly, the retransmission of network programing, including network programing which is broadcast in \u201cdistant\u201d markets, does not injure the copyright owner. The copyright owner contracts with the network on the basis of his programing reaching all markets served by the network and is compensated accordingly.By contrast, their retransmission of distant non-network programing by cable systems causes damage to the copyright owner by distributing the program in an area beyond which it has been licensed. Such retransmission adversely affects the ability of the copyright owner to exploit the work in the distant market. It is also of direct benefit to the cable system by enhancing its ability to attract subscribers and increase rev", "enues. For these reasons, the Committee has concluded that the copyright liability of cable television systems under the compulsory license should be limited to the retransmission of distant non-network programing.In implementing this conclusion, the Committee generally followed a proposal submitted by the cable and motion picture industries, the two industries most directly affected by the establishment of copyright royalties for cable television systems. Under the proposal, the royalty fee is determined by a two step computation. First, a value called a \u201cdistant signal equivalent\u201d is assigned to all \u201cdistant\u201d signals. Distant signals are defined as signals retransmitted by a cable system, in whole or in part, outside the local service area of the primary transmitter. Different values are assigned to independent, network, and educational stations because of the different amounts of viewing of non-network programing carried by such stations. For example, the viewing of non-network programs on network stations is considered to approximate 25 percent. These values are then combined and a scale of percentages is applied to the cumulative total.The Committee also considered various proposals to exempt certain categories of cable systems from royalty payments altogether. The Committee determined that the approach of the Senate bill to require some payment by every cable system is sound, but established separate fee schedules for cable systems whose gross receipts for the basic retransmission service do not exceed either $80,000 or $160,000 semiannually. It is the Committee\u2019s view that the fee schedules adopted for these systems are now appropriate, based on their relative size and the services performed.All the royalty payments required under the bill are paid on a semiannual basis to the Register of Copyrights. Each year they are distributed by the Copyright Royalty Commission to those copyright owners who may validly claim that their works were the subject of distant non-network retransmissions by cable systems.Base", "d on current estimates supplied to the Committee, the total royalty fees paid under the initial schedule established in the bill should approximate $8.7 million. Compared with the present number of cable television subscribers, calculated at 10.8 million, copyright payments under the bill would therefore approximate 81 cents per subscriber per year. The Committee believes that such payments are modest and will not retard the orderly development of the cable television industry or the service it provides to its subscribers.Analysis of Provisions.General Exemptions.The exemption would not apply if the secondary transmission consists of anything other than the mere relay of ordinary broadcasts. The cutting out of advertising, the running in of new commercials, or any other change in the signal relayed would subject the secondary transmitter to full liability. Moreover, the term \u201cprivate lodgings\u201d is limited to rooms used as living quarters or for private parties, and does not include dining rooms, meeting halls, theatres, ballrooms, or similar places that are outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances. No special exception is needed to make clear that the mere placing of an ordinary radio or television set in a private hotel room does not constitute an infringement.Secondary Transmissions of Instructional Broadcasts.Carriers.Clause (4) would exempt the activities of secondary transmitters that operate on a completely nonprofit basis. The operations of nonprofit \u201ctranslators\u201d or \u201cboosters,\u201d which do nothing more than amplify broadcast signals and retransmit them to everyone in an area for free reception, would be exempt if there is no \u201cpurpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage,\u201d and if there is no charge to the recipients \u201cother than assessments necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the secondary transmission service.\u201d This exemption does not apply to a cable television system.Secondary Transmissions of Primary Transmissions to Controlled Gr", "oup.The Senate bill contains a provision, however, stating that the secondary transmission does not constitute an act of infringement if the carriage of the signals comprising the secondary transmission is required under the rules and regulations of the FCC. The exclusive purpose of this provision is to exempt a cable system from copyright liability if the FCC should require cable systems to carry to their subscribers a \u201cscrambled\u201d pay signal of a subscription television station.The Committee is concerned, however, that the Senate bill is not clearly limited to the situation where a cable system is required by the FCC to carry a \u201cscrambled\u201d pay television signal. The Committee believes that the provision should not include any authority or permission to \u201cunscramble\u201d the signal. Further, the Senate bill does not make clear that the exception would not apply if the primary transmission is made by a cable system or cable system network transmitting its own originated program, e.gCompulsory License.Limitations on the Compulsory License.Section 111(c)(2) provides that the \u201cwillful or repeated\u201d carriage of signals not permissible under the rules and regulations of the FCC subjects a cable system to full copyright liability. The words \u201cwillful or repeated\u201d are used to prevent a cable system from being subjected to severe penalties for innocent or casual acts (\u201cRepeated\u201d does not mean merely \u201cmore than once,\u201d of course; rather, it denotes a degree of aggravated negligence which borders on willfulness. Such a condition would not exist in the case of an innocent mistake as to what signals or programs may properly be carried under the FCC\u2019s complicated rules). Section 111(c)(2) also provides that a cable system is subject to full copyright liability where the cable system has not recorded the notice, deposited the statement of account, or paid the royalty fee required by subsection (d). The Committee does not intend, however, that a good faith error by the cable system in computing the amount due would subject it to full li", "ability as an infringer. The Committee expects that in most instances of this type the parties would be able to work out the problem without resort to the courts.Commercial Substitution.Canadian and Mexican Signals.In the Committee\u2019s view, the authorization by the FCC to a cable system to carry a foreign signal does not resolve the copyright question of the royalty payment that should be made for copyrighted programs originating in the foreign country. The latter raises important international questions of the protection to be accorded foreign copyrighted works in the United States. While the Committee has established a general compulsory licensing scheme for the retransmission of copyrighted works of U.S. nationals, a broad compulsory license scheme for all foreign works does not appear warranted or justified. Thus, for example, if in the future the signal of a British, French, or Japanese station were retransmitted in the United States by a cable system, full copyright liability would apply.With respect to Canadian and Mexican signals, the Committee found that a special situation exists regarding the carriage of these signals by U.S. cable systems on the northern and southern borders, respectively. The Committee determined, therefore, that with respect to Canadian signals the compulsory license would apply in an area located 150 miles from the U.S.-Canadian border, or south from the border to the 42nd parallel of latitude, whichever distance is greater. Thus the cities of Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Green Bay and Seattle would be included within the compulsory license area, while cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco would be located outside the area.With respect to Mexican signals, the Commission determined that the compulsory license would apply only in the area in which such signals may be received by a U.S. cable system by means of direct interception of a free space radio wave. Thus, full copyright liability would apply if a cable system were required to use any equipment or", " device other than a receiving antenna to bring the signal to the community of the cable system.Further, to take account of those cable systems that are presently carrying or are specifically authorized to carry Canadian or Mexican signals, pursuant to FCC rules and regulations, and whether or not within the zones established, the Committee determined to grant a compulsory license for the carriage of those specific signals on those cable systems as in effect on April 15, 1976The Committee wishes to stress that cable systems operating within these zones are fully subject to the payment of royalty fees under the compulsory license for those foreign signals retransmitted. The copyright owners of the works transmitted may appear before the Copyright Royalty Commission and, pursuant to the provisions of this legislation, file claims to their fair share of the royalties collected. Outside the zones, however, full copyright liability would apply as would all the remedies of the legislation for any act of infringement.Requirements for a Compulsory License.Oct. 19, 1976Subsection (d)(2) directs cable systems whose secondary transmissions have been subject to compulsory licensing under subsection (c) to deposit with the Register of Copyrights a semi-annual statement of account. The dates for filing such statements of account and the six-month period which they are to cover are to be determined by the Register of Copyrights after consultation with the Copyright Royalty Commission. In addition to other such information that the Register may prescribe by regulation, the statements of account are to specify the number of channels on which the cable system made secondary transmissions to its subscribers, the names and locations of all primary transmitters whose transmissions were carried by the system, the total number of subscribers to the system, and the gross amounts paid to the system for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions. If any non-network television programming was retransmitted by the cable system b", "eyond the local service area of the primary transmitter, pursuant to the rules of the Federal Communications Commission, which under certain circumstances permit the substitution or addition of television signals not regularly carried, the cable system must deposit a special statement of account listing the times, dates, stations and programs involved in such substituted or added carriage.Copyright Royalty Payments.Subsection (d)(2)(B) provides that, except in the case of a cable system that comes within the gross receipts limitations of subclauses (C) and (D), the royalty fee is computed in the following manner:Every cable system pays .675 of 1 percent of its gross receipts for the privilege of retransmitting distant non-network programming, such amount to be applied against the fee, if any, payable under the computation for \u201cdistant signal equivalents.\u201d The latter are determined by adding together the values assigned to the actual number of distant television stations carried by a cable system. The purpose of this initial rate, applicable to all cable systems in this class, is to establish a basic payment, whether or not a particular cable system elects to transmit distant non-network programming. It is not a payment for the retransmission of purely \u201clocal\u201d signals, as is evident from the provision that it applies to and is deductible from the fee payable for any \u201cdistant signal equivalents.\u201dThe remaining provisions of subclause (B) establish the following rates for \u201cdistant signal equivalents:\u201dThe rate from zero to one distant signal equivalent is .675 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues. An additional .425 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be paid for each of the second, third and fourth distant signal equivalents that are carried. A further payment of .2 of 1 percent of gross subscriber revenues is to be made for each distant signal equivalent after the fourth. Any fraction of a distant signal equivalent is to be computed at its fractional value and where a cable system is located partly ", "within and partly without the local service area of a primary transmitter, the gross receipts subject to the percentage payment are limited to those gross receipts derived from subscribers located without the local service area of such primary transmitter.Pursuant to the foregoing formula, copyright payments as a percentage of gross receipts increase as the number of distant television signals carried by a cable system increases. Because many smaller cable systems carry a large number of distant signals, especially those located in areas where over-the-air television service is sparse, and because smaller cable systems may be less able to shoulder the burden of copyright payments than larger systems, the Committee decided to give special consideration to cable systems with semi-annual gross subscriber receipts of less than $160,000 ($320,000 annually). The royalty fee schedules for cable systems in this category are specified in subclauses (C) and (D).In lieu of the payments required in subclause (B), systems earning less than $80,000, semi-annually, are to pay a royalty fee of .5 of 1 percent of gross receipts. Gross receipts under this provision are computed, however, by subtracting from actual gross receipts collected during the payment period the amount by which $80,000 exceeds such actual gross receipts. Thus, if the actual gross receipts of the cable system for the period covered are $60,000, the fee is determined by subtracting $20,000 (the amount by which $80,000 exceeds actual gross receipts) from $60,000 and applying .5 of 1 percent to the $40,000 result. However, gross receipts in no case are to be reduced to less than $3,000.Under subclause (D), cable systems with semi-annual gross subscriber receipts of between $80,000 and $160,000 are to pay royalty fees of .5 of 1 percent of such actual gross receipts up to $80,000, and 1 percent of any actual gross receipts in excess of $80,000. The royalty fee payments under both subclauses (C) and (D) are to be determined without regard to the number of distant ", "signal equivalents, if any, carried by the subject cable systems.Copyright Royalty Distribution.The copyright owners entitled to participate in the distribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems under the compulsory license are specified in section 111(d)(4). Consistent with the Committee\u2019s view that copyright royalty fees should be made only for the retransmission of distant non-network programming, the claimants are limited to (1) copyright owners whose works were included in a secondary transmission made by a cable system of a distant non-network television program; (2) any copyright owner whose work is included in a secondary transmission identified in a special statement of account deposited under section 111(d)(2)(A); and (3) any copyright owner whose work was included in distant non-network programming consisting exclusively of aural signals. Thus, no royalty fees may be claimed or distributed to copyright owners for the retransmission of either \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cnetwork\u201d programs.The Committee recognizes that the bill does not include specific provisions to guide the Copyright Royalty Commission in determining the appropriate division among competing copyright owners of the royalty fees collected from cable systems under Section 111. The Committee concluded that it would not be appropriate to specify particular, limiting standards for distribution. Rather, the Committee believes that the Copyright Royalty Commission should consider all pertinent data and considerations presented by the claimants.Should disputes arise, however, between the different classes of copyright claimants, the Committee believes that the Copyright Royalty Commission should consider that with respect to the copyright owners of \u201clive\u201d programs identified by the special statement of account deposited under Section 111(d)(2)(A), a special payment is provided in Section 111(f).Section 111(d)(5) sets forth the procedure for the distribution of the royalty fees paid by cable systems. During the month of July of each year, every person c", "laiming to be entitled to compulsory license fees must file a claim with the Copyright Royalty Commission, in accordance with such provisions as the Commission shall establish. In particular, the Commission may establish the relevant period covered by such claims after giving adequate time for copyright owners to review and consider the statements of account filed by cable systems. Notwithstanding any provisions of the antitrust laws, the claimants may agree among themselves as to the division and distribution of such fees. After the first day of August of each year, the Copyright Royalty Commission shall determine whether a controversy exists concerning the distribution of royalty fees. If no controversy exists, the Commission, after deducting its reasonable administrative costs, shall distribute the fees to the copyright owners entitled or their agents. If the Commission finds the existence of a controversy, it shall, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 8 [\u00a7\u202f801 et seq. of this title], conduct a proceeding to determine the distribution of royalty fees.Off-Shore Taping by Cable Systems.Definitions.Primary and Secondary TransmissionsThe effect of this definition is to permit certain cable systems in offshore areas, but not including cable systems in the offshore area of Puerto Rico and to a limited extent only in Hawaii, to tape programs and retransmit them to subscribers under the compulsory license. Puerto Rico was excluded based upon a communication the Committee received from the Governor of Puerto Rico stating that the particular television broadcasting problems which the definition seeks to solve for cable systems in other noncontiguous areas do not exist in Puerto Rico. He therefore requested that Puerto Rico be excluded from the scope of the definition. All cable systems covered by the definition are subject to the conditions and limitations for nonsimultaneous transmissions established in section 111(e).Cable SystemLocal Service Area of a Primary TransmitterApril 15, 1976The \u201clocal service area of a pr", "imary transmitter\u201d of a Canadian or Mexican television station is defined as the area in which such station would be entitled to insist upon its signals being retransmitted if it were a television broadcast station subject to FCC rules and regulations. Since the FCC does not permit a television station licensed in a foreign country to assert a claim to carriage by a U.S. cable system, the local service area of such foreign station is considered to be the same area as if it were a U.S. station.The local service area for a radio broadcast station is defined to mean \u201cthe primary service area of such station pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission.\u201d The term \u201cprimary service area\u201d is defined precisely by the FCC with regard to AM stations in Section 73.11(a) of the FCC\u2019s rules. In the case of FM stations, \u201cprimary service area\u201d is regarded by the FCC as the area included within the field strength contours specified in Section 73.311 of its rules.Distant Signal EquivalentThe values assigned to independent, network and noncommercial educational stations are subject, however, to certain exceptions and limitations. Two of these relate to the mandatory and discretionary program deletion and substitution rules of the FCC. Where the FCC rules require a cable system to omit certain programs (e.g., the syndicated program exclusivity rules) and also permit the substitution of another program in place of the omitted program, no additional value is assigned for the substituted or additional program. Further, where the FCC rules on the date of enactment of this legislation permit a cable system, at its discretion, to make such deletions or substitutions or to carry additional programs not transmitted by primary transmitters within whose local service area the cable system is located, no additional value is assigned for the substituted or additional programs. However, the latter discretionary exception is subject to a condition that if the substituted or additional program is a \u201clive\u201d program", " (e.g., a sports event), then an additional value is assigned to the carriage of the distant signal computed as a fraction of one distant signal equivalent. The fraction is determined by assigning to the numerator the number of days in the year on which the \u201clive\u201d substitution occurs, and by assigning to the denominator the number of days in the year. Further, the discretionary exception is limited to those FCC rules in effect on the date of enactment of this legislation [Oct. 19, 1976Two further exceptions pertain to the late-night or specialty programming rules of the FCC or to a station carried on a part-time basis where full-time carriage is not possible because the cable system lacks the activated channel capacity to retransmit on a full-time basis all signals which it is authorized to carry. In this event, the values for independent, network and noncommercial, educational stations set forth above, as the case may be, are determined by multiplying each by a fraction which is equal to the ratio of the broadcast hours of such station carried by the cable system to the total broadcast hours of the station.Network StationIndependent StationNoncommercial Educational Stationsection 397 of title 4747 U.S.C. 397Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextThe date of the enactment of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, referred to in subsecs.

This is the problem of what are commonly called \u201cephemeral recordings\u201d: copies or phonorecords of a work made for purposes of later transmission by a broadcasting organization legally entitled to transmit the work. In other words, where a broadcaster has the privilege of performing or displaying a work either because he is licensed or because the performance or display is exempted under the statute, the question is whether he should be given the additional privilege of recording the performance or display to facilitate its transmission. The need for a limited exemption in these cases because of the practical exigencies of broadcasting has been generally recognized, but the scope of the exemption has been a controversial issue.Recordings for Licensed Transmissions.Organizations CoveredSome concern has been expressed by authors and publishers lest the term \u201corganization\u201d be construed to include a number of affiliated broadcasters who could exchange the recording without restrictions. The term is intended to cover a broadcasting network, or a local broadcaster or individual transmitter; but, under clauses (1) and (2) of the subsection, the ephemeral recording must be \u201cretained and used solely by the transmitting organization that made it,\u201d and must be used solely for that organization\u2019s own transmissions within its own area. Thus, an ephemeral recording made by one transmitter, whether it be a network or local broadcaster, could not be made available for use by another", " transmitter. Likewise, this subsection does not apply to those nonsimultaneous transmissions by cable systems not located within a boundary of the forty-eight contiguous States that are granted a compulsory license under section 111.Scope of the PrivilegeThree specific limitations on the scope of the ephemeral recording privilege are set out in subsection (a), and unless all are met the making of an \u201cephemeral recording\u201d becomes fully actionable as an infringement. The first requires that the copy or phonorecord be \u201cretained and used solely by the transmitting organization that made it,\u201d and that \u201cno further copies or phonorecords are reproduced from it.\u201d This means that a transmitting organization would have no privilege of exchanging ephemeral recordings with other transmitters or of allowing them to duplicate their own ephemeral recordings from the copy or phonorecord it has made. There is nothing in the provision to prevent a transmitting organization from having an ephemeral recording made by means of facilities other than its own, although it would not be permissible for a person or organization other than a transmitting organization to make a recording on its own initiative for possible sale or lease to a broadcaster. The ephemeral recording privilege would extend to copies or phonorecords made in advance for later broadcast, as well as recordings of a program that are made while it is being transmitted and are intended for deferred transmission or preservation.Clause (2) of section 112(a) provides that, to be exempt from copyright, the copy or phonorecord must be \u201cused solely for the transmitting organization\u2019s own transmissions within its local service area, or for purposes of archival preservation or security\u201d. The term \u201clocal service area\u201d is defined in section 111(f).Clause (3) of section 112(a) provides that, unless preserved exclusively for archival purposes, the copy or phonorecord of a transmission program must be destroyed within six months from the date the transmission program was first transm", "itted to the public.Recordings for Instructional Transmissions.Organizations CoveredMotion Pictures and Other Audiovisual WorksScope of the PrivilegeOn the other hand, if the nonprofit organization does nothing directly or indirectly to authorize, induce, or encourage others to duplicate additional copies or phonorecords of an ephemeral recording in excess of the limit of thirty, it would not be held responsible as participating in the infringement in such a case, and the unauthorized copies would not be counted against the organization\u2019s total of thirty.Unlike ephemeral recordings made under subsection (a), exchanges of recordings among instructional broadcasters are permitted. An organization that has made copies or phonorecords under subsection (b) may use one of them for purposes of its own transmissions that are exempted by section 110(2), and it may also transfer the other 29 copies to other instructional broadcasters for use in the same way.As in the case of ephemeral recordings made under section 112(a), a copy or phonorecord made for instructional broadcasting could be reused in any number of transmissions within the time limits specified in the provision. Because of the special problems of instructional broadcasters resulting from the scheduling of courses and the need to prerecord well in advance of transmission, the period of use has been extended to seven years from the date the transmission program was first transmitted to the public.Religious BroadcastsDespite objections by music copyright owners, the Committee found this exemption to be justified by the special circumstances under which many religious programs are broadcast. These programs are produced on tape or disk for distribution by mail of one copy only to each broadcast station carrying the program. None of the programs are prepared for profit, and the program producer either pays the station to carry the program or furnishes it free of charge. The stations have performing licenses, so the copyright owners receive compensation. Following th", "e performance, the tape is returned or the disk destroyed. It seems likely that, as has been alleged, to require a second payment for the mechanical reproduction under these circumstances would simply have the effect of driving some of the copyrighted music off the air.Ephemeral Recordings for Transmissions to Handicapped Audiences.Copyright Status of Ephemeral Recordings.Editorial NotesAmendments2004\u2014Subsec.

If the work is removed at the expense of the author, title to that copy of the work shall be deemed to be in the author.(3) The Register of Copyrights shall establish a system of records whereby any author of a work of visual art that has been incorporated in or made part of a building, may record his or her identity and address with the Copyright Office.

SteinMazerThe broad language of section 106(1) and of subsection (a) of section 113 raises questions as to the extent of copyright protection for a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work that portrays, depicts, or represents an image of a useful article in such a way that the utilitarian nature of the article can be seen. To take the example usually cited, would copyright in a drawing or model of an automobile give the artist the exclusive right to make automobiles of the same design?The 1961 Report of the Register of Copyrights stated, on the basis of judicial precedent, that \u201ccopyright in a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, portraying a useful article as such, does not extend to the manufact", "ure of the useful article itself,\u201d and recommended specifically that \u201cthe distinctions drawn in this area by existing court decisions\u201d not be altered by the statute. The Register\u2019s Supplementary Report, at page 48, cited a number of these decisions, and explained the insuperable difficulty of finding \u201cany statutory formulation that would express the distinction satisfactorily.\u201d Section 113(b) reflects the Register\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe real need is to make clear that there is no intention to change the present law with respect to the scope of protection in a work portraying a useful article as such.\u201dSection 113(c) provides that it would not be an infringement of copyright, where a copyright work has been lawfully published as the design of useful articles, to make, distribute or display pictures of the articles in advertising, in feature stories about the articles, or in the news reports.In conformity with its deletion from the bill of Title II, relating to the protection of ornamental designs of useful articles, the Committee has deleted subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 113 of S. 22 as adopted by the Senate, since they are no longer relevant.Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextSection 610(a) of the Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990 [Pub.

the programming of the broadcast transmission, the requirement of this clause shall not apply to a prior oral announcement by the broadcast station, or to an advance program schedule published,

Such rates and terms shall distinguish among the different types of services then in operation and shall include a minimum fee for each such type of service, such differences to be based on criteria including the quantity and nature of the use of sound recordings and the degree to which use of the service may substitute for or may promote the purchase of phonorecords by consumers. The Copyright Royalty Judges shall establish rates and terms that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller.

The notice and recordkeeping rules in effect on the day before the effective date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 shall remain in effect unless and until new regulations are promulgated by the Copyright Royalty Judges. If new regulations are promulgated under this subparagraph, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall take into account the substance and effect of the rules in effect on the day before the effective date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004 and shall, to the extent practicable, avoid significant disruption of the functions of an", "y designated agent authorized to collect and distribute royalty fees.(B) Any person who wishes to perform a sound recording publicly by means of a transmission eligible for statutory licensing under this subsection may do so without infringing the exclusive right of the copyright owner of the sound recording\u2014(i) by complying with such notice requirements as the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe by regulation and by paying royalty fees in accordance with this subsection; or(ii) if such royalty fees have not been set, by agreeing to pay such royalty fees as shall be determined in accordance with this subsection.(C) Any royalty payments in arrears shall be made on or before the twentieth day of the month next succeeding the month in which the royalty fees are set.(4)(A) Notwithstanding section 112(e) and the other provisions of this subsection, the receiving agent may enter into agreements for the reproduction and performance of sound recordings under section 112(e) and this section by any 1 or more commercial webcasters or noncommercial webcasters for a period of not more than 11 years beginning on January 1, 2005(B) The Copyright Office shall cause to be published in the Federal Register any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A).

Thereafter, the terms of such agreement shall be available, as an option, to any commercial webcaster or noncommercial webcaster meeting the eligibility conditions of such agreement.(C) Neither subparagraph (A) nor any provisions of any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A), including any rate structure, fees, terms, conditions, or notice and recordkeeping requirements set forth therein, shall be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into account in any administrative, judicial, or other government proceeding involving the setting or adjustment of the royalties payable for the public perfor", "mance or reproduction in ephemeral phonorecords or copies of sound recordings, the determination of terms or conditions related thereto, or the establishment of notice or recordkeeping requirements by the Copyright Royalty Judges under paragraph (3) or section 112(e)(4). It is the intent of Congress that any royalty rates, rate structure, definitions, terms, conditions, or notice and recordkeeping requirements, included in such agreements shall be considered as a compromise motivated by the unique business, economic and political circumstances of webcasters, copyright owners, and performers rather than as matters that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller, or otherwise meet the objectives set forth in section 801(b).

This term does not include the transmission of any audiovisual work.(6) An \u201celigible nonsubscription transmission\u201d is a noninteractive nonsubscription digital audio transmission not exempt under subsection (d)(1) that is made as part of a service that provides audio programming consisting, in whole or in part, of performances of sound recording", "s, including retransmissions of broadcast transmissions, if the primary purpose of the service is to provide to the public such audio or other entertainment programming, and the primary purpose of the service is not to sell, advertise, or promote particular products or services other than sound recordings, live concerts, or other music-related events.(7) An \u201cinteractive service\u201d is one that enables a member of the public to receive a transmission of a program specially created for the recipient, or on request, a transmission of a particular sound recording, whether or not as part of a program, which is selected by or on behalf of the recipient. The ability of individuals to request that particular sound recordings be performed for reception by the public at large, or in the case of a subscription service, by all subscribers of the service, does not make a service interactive, if the programming on each channel of the service does not substantially consist of sound recordings that are performed within 1 hour of the request or at a time designated by either the transmitting entity or the individual making such request. If an entity offers both interactive and noninteractive services (either concurrently or at different times), the noninteractive component shall not be treated as part of an interactive service.(8) A \u201cnew subscription service\u201d is a service that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive subscription digital audio transmissions and that is not a preexisting subscription service or a preexisting satellite digital audio radio service.(9) A \u201cnonsubscription\u201d transmission is any transmission that is not a subscription transmission.(10) A \u201cpreexisting satellite digital audio radio service\u201d is a subscription satellite digital audio radio service provided pursuant to a satellite digital audio radio service license issued by the Federal Communications Commission on or before July 31, 1998(11) A \u201cpreexisting subscription service\u201d is a service that performs sound recordings by means of noninteractive ", "audio-only subscription digital audio transmissions, which was in existence and was making such transmissions to the public for a fee on or before July 31, 1998(12) A \u201cretransmission\u201d is a further transmission of an initial transmission, and includes any further retransmission of the same transmission. Except as provided in this section, a transmission qualifies as a \u201cretransmission\u201d only if it is simultaneous with the initial transmission. Nothing in this definition shall be construed to exempt a transmission that fails to satisfy a separate element required to qualify for an exemption under section 114(d)(1).(13) The \u201csound recording performance complement\u201d is the transmission during any 3-hour period, on a particular channel used by a transmitting entity, of no more than\u2014(A) 3 different selections of sound recordings from any one phonorecord lawfully distributed for public performance or sale in the United States, if no more than 2 such selections are transmitted consecutively; or(B) 4 different selections of sound recordings\u2014(i) by the same featured recording artist; or(ii) from any set or compilation of phonorecords lawfully distributed together as a unit for public performance or sale in the United States,if no more than three such selections are transmitted consecutively:Provided(14) A \u201csubscription\u201d transmission is a transmission that is controlled and limited to particular recipients, and for which consideration is required to be paid or otherwise given by or on behalf of the recipient to receive the transmission or a package of transmissions including the transmission.(15) A \u201ctransmission\u201d is either an initial transmission or a retransmission.(Pub.

Subsection (a) states explicitly that the owner\u2019s rights \u201cdo not include any right of performance under section 106(4).\u201d The Committee considered at length the arguments in favor of establishing a limited performance right, in the form of a compulsory license, for copyrighted sound recordings, but concluded that the problem requires further study. It therefore added a new subsection (d) to the bill requiring the Register of Copyrights to submit to Congress, on January 3, 1978Subsection (b) of section 114 makes clear that statutory protection for sound recordings extends only to the particular sounds of which the recording consists, and would not prevent a separate recording of another performance in which those sounds are imitated. Thus, infringement takes place whenever all or any substantial portion of the actual sounds that go to make up a copyrighted sound recording are reproduced in phonorecords by repressing, transcribing, recapturing off the air, or any other method, or by reproducing them in the soundtrack or audio portion of a motion picture or other audiovisual work. Mere imitation of a recorded performance would not constitute a copyright infringement even where one performer deliberately sets out to simulate another\u2019s performance as exactly as possible.Under section 114, the exclusive right of owner of copyright in a sound recording to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted sound recording is recognized. Howev", "er, in view of the expressed intention not to give exclusive rights against imitative or simulated performances and recordings, the Committee adopted an amendment to make clear the scope of rights under section 106(2) in this context. Section 114(b) provides that the \u201cexclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording under clause (2) of section 106 is limited to the right to prepare a derivative work in which the actual sounds fixed in the sound recording are rearranged, remixed, or otherwise altered in sequence or quality.\u201dAnother amendment deals with the use of copyrighted sound recordings \u201cincluded in educational television and radio programs *\u2000*\u2000* distributed or transmitted by or through public broadcasting entities.\u201d This use of recordings is permissible without authorization from the owner of copyright in the sound recording, as long as \u201ccopies or phonorecords of said programs are not commercially distributed by or through public broadcasting entities to the general public.\u201dDuring the 1975 hearings, the Register of Copyrights expressed some concern that an invaluable segment of this country\u2019s musical heritage\u2014in the form of sound recordings\u2014had become inaccessible to musicologists and to others for scholarly purposes. Several of the major recording companies have responded to the Register\u2019s concern by granting blanket licenses to the Library of Congress to permit it to make single copy duplications of sound recordings maintained in the Library\u2019s archives for research purposes. Moreover, steps are being taken to determine the feasibility of additional licensing arrangements as a means of satisfying the needs of key regional music libraries across the country. The Register has agreed to report to Congress if further legislative consideration should be undertaken.Section 114(c) states explicitly that nothing in the provisions of section 114 should be construed to \u201climit or impair the exclusive right to perform publicly, by means of a phonorecord, any of the works specified by section 106(4).\u201d This", " principle is already implicit in the bill, but it is restated to avoid the danger of confusion between rights in a sound recording and rights in the musical composition or other work embodied in the recording.Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextSection 602(12) of the Communications Act of 1934, referred to in subsec.

Under these provisions, which represented a compromise of the most controversial issue of the 1909 act, a musical composition that has been reproduced in phonorec\u00adords with the permission of the copyright owne", "r may generally be reproduced in phonorecords by another person, if that person notifies the copyright owner and pays a specified royalty.The fundamental question of whether to retain the compulsory license or to do away with it altogether was a major issue during earlier stages of the program for general revision of the copyright law. At the hearings it was apparent that the argument on this point had shifted, and the real issue was not whether to retain the compulsory license but how much the royalty rate under it should be. The arguments for and against retention of the compulsory license are outlined at pages 66\u201367 of this Committee\u2019s 1967 report (H. Rept. No. 83, 90th Cong., 1st Sess.). The Committee\u2019s conclusion on this point remains the same as in 1967: \u201cthat a compulsory licensing system is still warranted as a condition for the rights of reproducing and distributing phonorecords of copyrighted music,\u201d but \u201cthat the present system is unfair and unnecessarily burdensome on copyright owners, and that the present statutory rate is too low.\u201dAvailability and Scope of Compulsory License.The present law, though not altogether clear, apparently bases compulsory licensing on the making or licensing of the first recording, even if no authorized records are distributed to the public. The first sentence of section 115(a)(1) would change the basis for compulsory licensing to authorized public distribution of phonorecords (including disks and audio tapes but not the sound tracks or other sound records accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work). Under the clause, a compulsory license would be available to anyone as soon as \u201cphonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distributed to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner.\u201dThe second sentence of clause (1), which has been the subject of some debate, provides that \u201ca person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use.\u201d", " This provision was criticized as being discriminatory against background music systems, since it would prevent a background music producer from making recordings without the express consent of the copyright owner; it was argued that this could put the producer at a great competitive disadvantage with performing rights societies, allow discrimination, and destroy or prevent entry of businesses. The committee concluded, however, that the purpose of the compulsory license does not extend to manufacturers of phonorecords that are intended primarily for commercial use, including not only broadcasters and jukebox operators but also background music services.The final sentence of clause (1) provides that a person may not obtain a compulsory license for use of the work in the duplication of a sound recording made by another, unless the sound recording being duplicated was itself fixed lawfully and the making of phonorecords duplicated from it was authorized by the owner of copyright in the sound recording (or, if the recording was fixed before February 15, 1972Duchess Music Corp. v. SternEdward B. Marks Music Corp. v. Colorado Magnetics, IncJondora Music Publishing Co. v. Melody Recordings, IncFame Publishing Co. v. Alabama Custom Tape, IncUnder this provision, it would be possible to obtain a compulsory license for the use of copyrighted music under section 115 if the owner of the sound recording being duplicated authorizes its duplication. This does not, however, in any way require the owner of the original sound recording to grant a license to duplicate the original sound recording. It is not intended that copyright protection for sound recordings be circumscribed by requiring the owners of sound recordings to grant a compulsory license to unauthorized duplicators or others.The second clause of subsection (a) is intended to recognize the practical need for a limited privilege to make arrangements of music being used under a compulsory license, but without allowing the music to be perverted, distorted, or travestied. ", "Clause (2) permits arrangements of a work \u201cto the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved,\u201d so long as it does not \u201cchange the basic melody or fundamental character of the work.\u201d The provision also prohibits the compulsory licensee from claiming an independent copyright in his arrangement as a \u201cderivative work\u201d without the express consent of the copyright owner.Procedure for Obtaining Compulsory License.The Committee deleted clause (2) of section 115(b) of S. 22 as adopted by the Senate. The provision was a vestige of jukebox provisions in earlier bills, and its requirements no longer served any useful purpose.Clause (2) [formerly clause (3)] of section 115(b) [cl. (2) of subsec. (b) of this section] provides that \u201cfailure to serve or file the notice required by clause (1) *\u2000*\u2000* forecloses the possibility of a compulsory license and, in the absence of a negotiated license, renders the making and distribution of phonorecords actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the remedies provided by sections 502 through 506.\u201d The remedies provided in section 501 are those applicable to infringements generally.Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License. Identification of Copyright OwnerBasis of RoyaltyIt is intended that the Register of Copyrights will prescribe regulations insuring that copyright owners will receive full and prompt payment for all phonorec\u00adords made and distributed. Section 115(c)(2) states that \u201ca phonorecord is considered \u2018distributed\u2019 if the person exercising the compulsory license has voluntarily and permanently parted with its possession.\u201d For this purpose, the concept of \u201cdistribution\u201d comprises any act by which the person exercising the compulsory license voluntarily relinquishes possession of a phonorecord (considered as a fungible unit), regardless of whether the distribution is to the public, passes title, constitutes a gift, or is sold, rented, leased, or loaned, unless it is actually returned and the trans", "action cancelled. Neither involuntary relinquishment, as through theft or fire, nor the destruction of unwanted records, would constitute \u201cdistribution.\u201dThe term \u201cmade\u201d is intended to be broader than \u201cmanufactured,\u201d and to include within its scope every possible manufacturing or other process capable of reproducing a sound recording in phonorecords. The use of the phrase \u201cmade and distributed\u201d establishes the basis upon which the royalty rate for compulsory licensing under section 115 is to be calculated, but it is in no way intended to weaken the liability of record pressers and other manufacturers and makers of phonorecords for copyright infringement where the compulsory licensing requirements have not been met. As under the present law, even if a presser, manufacturer, or other maker had no role in the distribution process, that person would be regarded as jointly and severally liable in a case where the court finds that infringement has taken place because of failure to comply with the provisions of section 115.Under existing practices in the record industry, phonorecords are distributed to wholesalers and retailers with the privilege of returning unsold copies for credit or exchange. As a result, the number of recordings that have been \u201cpermanently\u201d distributed will not usually be known until some time\u2014six or seven months on the average\u2014after the initial distribution. In recognition of this problem, it has become a well-established industry practice, under negotiated licenses, for record companies to maintain reasonable reserves of the mechanical royalties due the copyright owners, against which royalties on the returns can be offset. The Committee recognizes that this practice may be consistent with the statutory requirements for monthly compulsory license accounting reports, but recognizes the possibility that, without proper safeguards, the maintenance of such reserves could be manipulated to avoid making payments of the full amounts owing to copyright owners. Under these circumstances, the regulations pr", "escribed by the Register of Copyrights should contain detailed provisions ensuring that the ultimate disposition of every phonorecord made under a compulsory license is accounted for, and that payment is made for every phonorecord \u201cvoluntarily and permanently\u201d distributed. In particular, the Register should prescribe a point in time when, for accounting purposes under section 115, a phonorecord will be considered \u201cpermanently distributed,\u201d and should prescribe the situations in which a compulsory licensee is barred from maintaining reserves (e.g., situations in which the compulsory licensee has frequently failed to make payments in the past.)Rate of RoyaltyWhile upon initial review it might be assumed that the rate established in 1909 would not be reasonable at the present time, the committee believes that an increase in the mechanical royalty rate must be justified on the basis of existing economic conditions and not on the mere passage of 67 years. Following a thorough analysis of the problem, the Committee considers that an increase of the present two-cent royalty to a rate of 2\u00be cents (or .6 of one cent per minute or fraction of playing time) is justified. This rate will be subject to review by the Copyright Royalty Commission, as provided by section 801, in 1980 and at 10-year intervals thereafter.Accounting and Payment of Royalties; Effect of Default.A source of criticism with respect to the compulsory licensing provisions of the present statute has been the rather ineffective sanctions against default by compulsory licensees. Clause (4) of section 115(c) corrects this defect by permitting the copyright owner to serve written notice on a defaulting licensee, and by providing for termination of the compulsory license if the default is not remedied within 30 days after notice is given. Termination under this clause \u201crenders either the making or the distribution, or both, of all phonorecords for which the royalty had not been paid, actionable as acts of infringement under section 501 and fully subject to the r", "emedies provided by sections 502 through 506.\u201dEditorial Notes\nReferences in TextThe date of enactment of the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995, referred to in subsec.

This is the area of computer uses of copyrighted works: the use of a work \u201cin conjunction with automatic systems capable of stor", "ing, processing, retrieving, or transferring information.\u201d The Commission on New Technological Uses is, among other things, now engaged in making a thorough study of the emerging patterns in this field and it will, on the basis of its findings, recommend definitive copyright provisions to deal with the situation.Since it would be premature to change existing law on computer uses at present, the purpose of section 117 is to preserve the status quo. It is intended neither to cut off any rights that may now exist, nor to create new rights that might be denied under the Act of 1909 or under common law principles currently applicable.The provision deals only with the exclusive rights of a copyright owner with respect to computer uses, that is, the bundle of rights specified for other types of uses in section 106 and qualified in sections 107 through 116 and 118. With respect to the copyright-ability of computer programs, the ownership of copyrights in them, the term of protection, and the formal requirements of the remainder of the bill, the new statute would apply.Under section 117, an action for infringement of a copyrighted work by means of a computer would necessarily be a federal action brought under the new title 17. The court, in deciding the scope of exclusive rights in the computer area, would first need to determine the applicable law, whether State statutory or common law or the Act of 1909. Having determined what law was applicable, its decision would depend upon its interpretation of what that law was on the point on the day before the effective date of the new statute.Editorial NotesAmendments1998\u2014Pub.

The parties to each negotiation proceeding shall bear their own costs.(4) In the absence of license agreements negotiated under paragraph (2) or (3), the Copyright Royalty Judges shall, pursuant to chapter 8, conduct a proceeding to determine and publish in the Federal Register a schedule of rates and terms which, subject to paragraph (2), shall be binding on all owners of copyright in works specified by this subsection and public broadcasting entities, regardless of whether such copyright owners have submitted proposals to the Copyright Royalty Judges. In establishing such rates a", "nd terms the Copyright Royalty Judges may consider the rates for comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements negotiated as provided in paragraph (2) or (3). The Copyright Royalty Judges shall also establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their works under this section, and under which records of such use shall be kept by public broadcasting entities.(c) Subject to the terms of any voluntary license agreements that have been negotiated as provided by subsection (b)(2) or (3), a public broadcasting entity may, upon compliance with the provisions of this section, including the rates and terms established by the Copyright Royalty Judges under subsection (b)(4), engage in the following activities with respect to published nondramatic musical works and published pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works:(1) performance or display of a work by or in the course of a transmission made by a noncommercial educational broadcast station referred to in subsection (f); and(2) production of a transmission program, reproduction of copies or phonorecords of such a transmission program, and distribution of such copies or phonorecords, where such production, reproduction, or distribution is made by a nonprofit institution or organization solely for the purpose of transmissions specified in paragraph (1); and(3) the making of reproductions by a governmental body or a nonprofit institution of a transmission program simultaneously with its transmission as specified in paragraph (1), and the performance or display of the contents of such program under the conditions specified by paragraph (1) of section 110, but only if the reproductions are used for performances or displays for a period of no more than seven days from the date of the transmission specified in paragraph (1), and are destroyed before or at the end of such period. No person supplying, in accordance with paragraph (2), a reproduction of a transmission program to governmental bodies or nonprofit institutions", " under this paragraph shall have any liability as a result of failure of such body or institution to destroy such reproduction: ProvidedAnd provided further(d) Except as expressly provided in this subsection, this section shall have no applicability to works other than those specified in subsection (b). Owners of copyright in nondramatic literary works and public broadcasting entities may, during the course of voluntary negotiations, agree among themselves, respectively, as to the terms and rates of royalty payments without liability under the antitrust laws. Any such terms and rates of royalty payments shall be effective upon filing with the Copyright Royalty Judges, in accordance with regulations that the Copyright Royalty Judges shall prescribe as provided in section 803(b)(6).(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit, beyond the limits of fair use as provided by section 107, the unauthorized dramatization of a nondramatic musical work, the production of a transmission program drawn to any substantial extent from a published compilation of pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, or the unauthorized use of any portion of an audiovisual work.(f) As used in this section, the term \u201cpublic broadcasting entity\u201d means a noncommercial educational broadcast station as defined in section 397 of title 47(Pub.

During the period between the effective date of the Act [Jan. 1, 1978December 31, 1977License agreements that have been voluntarily negotiated supersede, as between the parties to the agreement, the terms and rates established by the Commission, provided that copies of the agreements are properly filed with the Copyright Office within 30 days of execution. Under clause (2) of section 118(b), the agreements may be negotiated \u201cat any time\u201d\u2014whether before, during, or after determinations by the Commission.Under section 118(c), the procedures for the Commission\u2019s establishing such rates and terms are to be repeated in the last half of 1982 and every five years thereafter.Establishment of Reasonable Terms and Rates.The Committee does not intend that owners of copyrighted material be required to subsidize public broadcasting. It is intended that the Commission assure a fair return to copyright owners without unfairly burdening public broadcasters. Section 118(b)(3) provides that \u201cthe Commission may consider the rates for comparable circumstances under voluntary license agreements.\u201d The Commission is also expected to consider both the general public interest in encouraging the growth and development of public broadcasting, and the \u201cpromotion of science and the useful arts\u201d through the encouragement of musical and artistic creation.The Committee anticipates that the \u201cterms\u201d established by the Commission shall include provisions as to acceptable methods of payment of royalties by public broadcasting entities to copyright owners. For example, where the whereabouts of the copyright owner may not be readily known, the terms should specify the nature of the obligation of the p", "ublic broadcasting entity to locate the owner, or to set aside or otherwise assure payment of appropriate royalties, should he or she appear and make a claim. Section 118(b)(3) requires the Commission \u201cto establish requirements by which copyright owners may receive reasonable notice of the use of their works.\u201d The Committee intends that these requirements shall not impose undue hardships on public broadcasting entities and, in the above illustration, shall provide for the specific termination of any period during which the public broadcasting entity is required to set aside payments. It is expected that, in some cases, especially in the area of pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, the whereabouts of the owners of copyright may not be known and they may never appear to claim payment of royalties.The Commission is also to establish record keeping requirements for public broadcasting entities in order to facilitate the identification, calculation, allocation and payment of claims and royalties.Works Affected.Section 118(f) is intended to make clear that this section does not permit unauthorized use, beyond the limits of section 107, of individual frames from a filmstrip or any other portion of any audiovisual work. Additionally, the application of this section to pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works does not extend to the production of transmission programs drawn to any substantial extent from a compilation of such works.The Committee also concluded that the performance of nondramatic literary works should not be subject to Commission determination. It was particularly concerned that a compulsory license for literary works would result in loss of control by authors over the use of their work in violation of basic principles of artistic and creative freedom. It is recognized that copyright not only provides compensation to authors, but also protection as to how and where their works are used. The Committee was assured by representatives of authors and publishers that licensing arrangements for readings from ", "their books, poems, and other works on public broadcasting programs for reasonable compensation and under reasonable safeguards for authors\u2019 rights could be worked out in private negotiation. The Committee strongly urges the parties to work toward mutually acceptable licenses; to facilitate their negotiations and aid in the possible establishment of clearance mechanisms and rates, the Committee\u2019s amendment provides the parties, in section 118(e)(1), with an appropriately limited exemption from the antitrust laws [15 U.S.C. 1The Committee has also provided, in paragraph (2) of clause (e), that on January 3, 1980The use of copyrighted sound recordings in educational television and radio programs distributed by or through public broadcasting entities is governed by section 114 and is discussed in connection with that section.Activities Affected.Paragraph (3) of clause (d) also includes the reproduction, simultaneously with transmission, of public broadcasting programs by governmental bodies or nonprofit institutions, and the performance or display of the contents of the reproduction under the conditions of section 110(1). However, the reproduction so made must be destroyed at the end of seven days from the transmission.This limited provision for unauthorized simultaneous or off-the-air reproduction is limited to nondramatic musical works and pictorial, graphic and sculptural works included in public broadcasting transmissions. It does not extend to other works included in the transmissions, or to the entire transmission program.It is the intent of the Committee that schools be permitted to engage in off-the-air reproduction to the extent and under the conditions provided in [section] 118(d)(3); however, in the event a public broadcasting station or producer makes the reproduction and distributes a copy to the school, the station or producer will not be held liable for the school\u2019s failure to destroy the reproduction, provided it has given notice of the requirement of destruction. In such a case the school itself, al", "though it did not engage in the act of reproduction, is deemed an infringer fully subject to the remedies provided in Chapter 5 of the Act [\u00a7\u202f501 et seq. of this title]. The establishment of standards for adequate notice under this provision should be considered by the Commission.Section 118(f) makes it clear that the rights of performance and other activities specified in subsection (d) do not extend to the unauthorized dramatization of a nondramatic musical work.Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextSubsection (d), referred to in subsec.

Ownership of copyright(a) Initial OwnershipCopyright in a work protected under this title vests initially in the author or authors of the work. The authors of a joint work are coowners of copyright in the work.(b) Works Made for HireIn the case of a work made for hire, the employer or other person for whom the work was prepared is considered the author for purposes of this title, and, unless the parties have expressly agreed otherwise in a written instrument signed by them, owns all of the rights comprised in the copyright.(c) Contributions to Collective WorksCopyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from copyright in the collect", "ive work as a whole, and vests initially in the author of the contribution. In the absence of an express transfer of the copyright or of any rights under it, the owner of copyright in the collective work is presumed to have acquired only the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.(d) Transfer of Ownership.\u2014(1) The ownership of a copyright may be transferred in whole or in part by any means of conveyance or by operation of law, and may be bequeathed by will or pass as personal property by the applicable laws of intestate succession.(2) Any of the exclusive rights comprised in a copyright, including any subdivision of any of the rights specified by section 106, may be transferred as provided by clause (1) and owned separately. The owner of any particular exclusive right is entitled, to the extent of that right, to all of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by this title.(e) Involuntary TransferWhen an individual author\u2019s ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, has not previously been transferred voluntarily by that individual author, no action by any governmental body or other official or organization purporting to seize, expropriate, transfer, or exercise rights of ownership with respect to the copyright, or any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, shall be given effect under this title, except as provided under title 11.(Pub.

L. 95\u2013598, title III, \u00a7\u202f313Nov. 6, 197892 Stat. 2676\nHistorical and Revision Noteshouse report no. 94\u20131476Initial Ownership.The definition of \u201cjoint works\u201d has prompted some concern lest it be construed as converting the authors of previously written works, such as plays, novels, and music, into coauthors of a motion picture in which their work is incorporated. It is true that a motion picture would normally be a joint r", "ather than a collective work with respect to those authors who actually work on the film, although their usual status as employees for hire would keep the question of coownership from coming up. On the other hand, although a novelist, playwright, or songwriter may write a work with the hope or expectation that it will be used in a motion picture, this is clearly a case of separate or independent authorship rather than one where the basic intention behind the writing of the work was for motion picture use. In this case, the motion picture is a derivative work within the definition of that term, and section 103 makes plain that copyright in a derivative work is independent of, and does not enlarge the scope of rights in, any preexisting material incorporated in it. There is thus no need to spell this conclusion out in the definition of \u201cjoint work.\u201dThere is also no need for a specific statutory provision concerning the rights and duties of the coowners of a work; court-made law on this point is left undisturbed. Under the bill, as under the present law, coowners of a copyright would be treated generally as tenants in common, with each coowner having an independent right to use or license the use of a work, subject to a duty of accounting to the other coowners for any profits.Works Made for Hire.The work-made-for-hire provisions of this bill represent a carefully balanced compromise, and as such they do not incorporate the amendments proposed by screenwriters and composers for motion pictures. Their proposal was for the recognition of something similar to the \u201cshop right\u201d doctrine of patent law: with some exceptions, the employer would acquire the right to use the employee\u2019s work to the extent needed for purposes of his regular business, but the employee would retain all other rights as long as he or she refrained from the authorizing of competing uses. However, while this change might theoretically improve the bargaining position of screenwriters and others as a group, the practical benefits that individual authors", " would receive are highly conjectural. The presumption that initial ownership rights vest in the employer for hire is well established in American copyright law, and to exchange that for the uncertainties of the shop right doctrine would not only be of dubious value to employers and employees alike, but might also reopen a number of other issues.The status of works prepared on special order or commission was a major issue in the development of the definition of \u201cworks made for hire\u201d in section 101, which has undergone extensive revision during the legislative process. The basic problem is how to draw a statutory line between those works written on special order or commission that should be considered as \u201cworks made for hire,\u201d and those that should not. The definition now provided by the bill represents a compromise which, in effect, spells out those specific categories of commissioned works that can be considered \u201cworks made for hire\u201d under certain circumstances.Of these, one of the most important categories is that of \u201cinstructional texts.\u201d This term is given its own definition in the bill: \u201ca literary, pictorial, or graphic work prepared for publication with the purpose of use in systematic instructional activities.\u201d The concept is intended to include what might be loosely called \u201ctextbook material,\u201d whether or not in book form or prepared in the form of text matter. The basic characteristic of \u201cinstructional texts\u201d is the purpose of their preparation for \u201cuse in systematic instructional activities,\u201d and they are to be distinguished from works prepared for use by a general readership.Contributions to Collective Works.The bill does nothing to change the rights of the owner of copyright in a collective work under the present law. These exclusive rights extend to the elements of compilation and editing that went into the collective work as a whole, as well as the contributions that were written for hire by employees of the owner of the collective work, and those copyrighted contributions that have been transferred", " in writing to the owner by their authors. However, one of the most significant aims of the bill is to clarify and improve the present confused and frequently unfair legal situation with respect to rights in contributions.The second sentence of section 201(c), in conjunction with the provisions of section 404 dealing with copyright notice, will preserve the author\u2019s copyright in a contribution even if the contribution does not bear a separate notice in the author\u2019s name, and without requiring any unqualified transfer of rights to the owner of the collective work. This is coupled with a presumption that, unless there has been an express transfer of more, the owner of the collective work acquires, \u201conly the privilege of reproducing and distributing the contribution as part of that particular collective work, any revision of that collective work, and any later collective work in the same series.\u201dThe basic presumption of section 201(c) is fully consistent with present law and practice, and represents a fair balancing of equities. At the same time, the last clause of the subsection, under which the privilege of republishing the contribution under certain limited circumstances would be presumed, is an essential counterpart of the basic presumption. Under the language of this clause a publishing company could reprint a contribution from one issue in a later issue of its magazine, and could reprint an article from a 1980 edition of an encyclopedia in a 1990 revision of it; the publisher could not revise the contribution itself or include it in a new anthology or an entirely different magazine or other collective work.Transfer of Ownership.Clause (2) of subsection (d) contains the first explicit statutory recognition of the principle of divisibility of copyright in our law. This provision, which has long been sought by authors and their representatives, and which has attracted wide support from other groups, means that any of the exclusive rights that go to make up a copyright, including those enumerated in section 106 an", "d any subdivision of them, can be transferred and owned separately. The definition of \u201ctransfer of copyright ownership\u201d in section 101 makes clear that the principle of divisibility applies whether or not the transfer is \u201climited in time or place of effect,\u201d and another definition in the same section provides that the term \u201ccopyright owner,\u201d with respect to any one exclusive right, refers to the owner of that particular right. The last sentence of section 201(d)(2) adds that the owner, with respect to the particular exclusive right he or she owns, is entitled \u201cto all of the protection and remedies accorded to the copyright owner by this title.\u201d It is thus clear, for example, that a local broadcasting station holding an exclusive license to transmit a particular work within a particular geographic area and for a particular period of time, could sue, in its own name as copyright owner, someone who infringed that particular exclusive right.Subsection (e) provides that when an individual author\u2019s ownership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, have not previously been voluntarily transferred, no action by any governmental body or other official or organization purporting to seize, expropriate, transfer, or exercise rights of ownership with respect to the copyright, or any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, shall be given effect under this title.The purpose of this subsection is to reaffirm the basic principle that the United States copyright of an individual author shall be secured to that author, and cannot be taken away by any involuntary transfer. It is the intent of the subsection that the author be entitled, despite any purported expropriation or involuntary transfer, to continue exercising all rights under the United States statute, and that the governmental body or organization may not enforce or exercise any rights under this title in that situation.It may sometimes be difficult to ascertain whether a transfer of copyright is voluntary or is coerced by covert pressure. B", "ut subsection (e) would protect foreign authors against laws and decrees purporting to divest them of their rights under the United States copyright statute, and would protect authors within the foreign country who choose to resist such covert pressures.Traditional legal actions that may involve transfer of ownership, such as bankruptcy proceedings and mortgage foreclosures, are not within the scope of this subsection; the authors in such cases have voluntarily consented to these legal processes by their overt actions\u2014for example, by filing in bankruptcy or by hypothecating a copyright.Editorial NotesAmendments1978\u2014Subsec.

Ownership of copyright as distinct from ownership of material object\nOwnership of a copyright, or of any of the exclusive rights under a copyright, is distinct from ownership of any material object in which the work is embodied. Transfer of ownership of any material object, including the copy or phonorecord in which the work is first fixed, does not of itself convey any rights in the copyrighted work embodied in the object; nor, in the absence of an agreement, does transfer of ownership of a copyright or of any exclusive rights under a copyright convey property rights in any material object.(Pub.

Conversely, transfe", "r of a copyright does not necessarily require the conveyance of any material object.As a result of the interaction of this section and the provisions of section 204(a) and 301, the bill would change a common law doctrine exemplified by the decision in Pushman v.

Termination of transfers and licenses granted by the author(a) Conditions for TerminationIn the case of any work other than a work made for hire, the exclusive or nonexclusive grant of a transfer or license of copyright or of any right under a copyright, executed by the author on or after January 1, 1978(1) In the case of a grant executed by one author, termination of the grant may be effected by that author or, if the author is dead, by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than one-half of that author\u2019s termination interest. In the case of a grant executed by two or more authors of a joint work, termination of the grant may be effected by a majority of the authors who executed it; if any of such authors is dead, the termination interest of any such author may be exercised as a unit by the person or persons who, under clause (2) of this subsection, own and are entitled to exercise a total of more than one-half of that author\u2019s interest.(2) Where an author is dead, his or her termination interest is owned, and may be exercised, as follows:(A) The widow or widower owns the author\u2019s entire termination interest unless there are any surviving children or grandchildren of the author, in which case the widow or widower owns one-half of the author\u2019s interest.(B) The author\u2019s surviving children, and the surviving children of any dead child of the author, own the author\u2019s entire termination interest unless there is a widow or widower, in which case the ownership of one-half of the author\u2019s interest is divided among them.(C) The rights of the author\u2019s children and grandchildren are in all cases divided among them and exercised on a per stirpes basis accor", "ding to the number of such author\u2019s children represented; the share of the children of a dead child in a termination interest can be exercised only by the action of a majority of them.(D) In the event that the author\u2019s widow or widower, children, and grandchildren are not living, the author\u2019s executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee shall own the author\u2019s entire termination interest.(3) Termination of the grant may be effected at any time during a period of five years beginning at the end of thirty-five years from the date of execution of the grant; or, if the grant covers the right of publication of the work, the period begins at the end of thirty-five years from the date of publication of the work under the grant or at the end of forty years from the date of execution of the grant, whichever term ends earlier.(4) The termination shall be effected by serving an advance notice in writing, signed by the number and proportion of owners of termination interests required under clauses (1) and (2) of this subsection, or by their duly authorized agents, upon the grantee or the grantee\u2019s successor in title.(A) The notice shall state the effective date of the termination, which shall fall within the five-year period specified by clause (3) of this subsection, and the notice shall be served not less than two or more than ten years before that date. A copy of the notice shall be recorded in the Copyright Office before the effective date of termination, as a condition to its taking effect.(B) The notice shall comply, in form, content, and manner of service, with requirements that the Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.(5) Termination of the grant may be effected notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, including an agreement to make a will or to make any future grant.(b) Effect of TerminationUpon the effective date of termination, all rights under this title that were covered by the terminated grants revert to the author, authors, and other persons owning termination interests und", "er clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a), including those owners who did not join in signing the notice of termination under clause (4) of subsection (a), but with the following limitations:(1) A derivative work prepared under authority of the grant before its termination may continue to be utilized under the terms of the grant after its termination, but this privilege does not extend to the preparation after the termination of other derivative works based upon the copyrighted work covered by the terminated grant.(2) The future rights that will revert upon termination of the grant become vested on the date the notice of termination has been served as provided by clause (4) of subsection (a).

Such further grant or agreement is effective with respect to all of the persons in whom the right it covers has vested under clause (2) of this subsection, including those who did not join in signing it. If any person dies after rights under a terminated grant have vested in him or her, that person\u2019s legal representatives, legatees, or heirs at law represent him or her for purposes of this clause.(4) A further grant, or agreement to make a further grant, of any right covered by a terminated grant is valid only if it is made after the effective date of the termination. As an exception, however, an agreement for such a further grant may be made between the persons provided by clause (3) of this subsection and the original grantee or such grantee\u2019s successor in title, after the notice of terminati", "on has been served as provided by clause (4) of subsection (a).(5) Termination of a grant under this section affects only those rights covered by the grants that arise under this title, and in no way affects rights arising under any other Federal, State, or foreign laws.(6) Unless and until termination is effected under this section, the grant, if it does not provide otherwise, continues in effect for the term of copyright provided by this title.(Pub.

The scope of the right would extend not only to any \u201ctransfer of copyright ownership,\u201d as defined in section 101, but also to nonexclusive licenses. The right of termination would not apply to \u201cworks made for hire,\u201d which is one of the principal reasons the definition of that term assumed importance in the development of the bill.Who Can Terminate a Grant.1. In the case of a work of joint authorship, where the grant was signed by two or more of the authors, majority action by those who signed the grant, or by their interests, would be required to terminate it.2. There are three different situations in which the shares of joint authors, or of a dead author\u2019s widow or widower, children, and grandchildren, must be divided under the statute: (1) The right to effect a termination; (2) the ownership of the terminated rights; and (3) the right to make further grants of reverted rights. The respective shares of the authors, and of a dead author\u2019s widow or widower, children, and grandchildren, would be divided in exactly the same way in each of these situations. The terms \u201cwidow,\u201d \u201c", "widower,\u201d and \u201cchildren\u201d are defined in section 101 in an effort to avoid problems and uncertainties that have arisen under the present renewal section.3. The principle of per stirpes representation would also be applied in exactly the same way in all three situations. Take for example, a case where a dead author left a widow, two living children, and three grandchildren by a third child who is dead. The widow will own half of the reverted interests, the two children will each own 16\u2154 percent, and the three grandchildren will each own a share of roughly 5\u00bd percent. But who can exercise the right of termination? Obviously, since she owns 50 percent, the widow is an essential party, but suppose neither of the two surviving children is willing to join her in the termination; is it enough that she gets one of the children of the dead child to join, or can the dead child\u2019s interest be exercised only by the action of a majority of his children? Consistent with the per stirpes principle, the interest of a dead child can be exercised only as a unit by majority action of his surviving children. Thus, even though the widow and one grandchild would own 55\u00bd percent of the reverted copyright, they would have to be joined by another child or grandchild in order to effect a termination or a further transfer of reverted rights. This principle also applies where, for example, two joint authors executed a grant and one of them is dead; in order to effect a termination, the living author must be joined by a per stirpes majority of the dead author\u2019s beneficiaries. The notice of termination may be signed by the specified owners of termination interests or by \u201ctheir duly authorized agents,\u201d which would include the legally appointed guardians or committees of persons incompetent to sign because of age or mental disability.When a Grant Can be Terminated.The effective date of termination, which must be stated in the advance notice, is required to fall within the 5 years following the end of the applicable 35- or 40-year period, but the a", "dvance notice itself must be served earlier. Under section 203(a)(4)(A), the notice must be served \u201cnot less than two or more than ten years\u201d before the effective date stated in it.As an example of how these time-limit requirements would operate in practice, we suggest two typical contract situations:Case 1: Contract for theatrical production signed on September 2, 1987September 2, 2022September 1, 2027September 1, 2022September 1, 2012September 1, 2020Case 2: Contract for book publication executed on April 10, 1980August 23, 1987April 10, 2020April 10, 2015August 23, 2022January 1, 2024January 1, 2014January 1, 2022Effect of Termination.Under the bill, termination means that ownership of the rights covered by the terminated grant reverts to everyone who owns termination interests on the date the notice of termination was served, whether they joined in signing the notice or not. In other words, if a person could have signed the notice, that person is bound by the action of the majority who did; the termination of the grant will be effective as to that person, and a proportionate share of the reverted rights automatically vests in that person. Ownership is divided proportionately on the same per stirpes basis as that provided for the right to effect termination under section 203(a) and, since the reverted rights vest on the date notice is served, the heirs of a dead beneficiary would inherit his or her share.Under clause (3) of subsection (b), majority action is required to make a further grant of reverted rights. A problem here, of course, is that years may have passed between the time the reverted rights vested and the time the new owners want to make a further transfer; people may have died and children may have been born in the interim. To deal with this problem, the bill looks back to the date of vesting; out of the group in whom rights vested on that date, it requires the further transfer or license to be signed by \u201cthe same number and proportion of the owners\u201d (though not necessarily the same individuals) a", "s were then required to terminate the grant under subsection (a). If some of those in whom the rights originally vested have died, their \u201clegal representatives, legatees, or heirs at law\u201d may represent them for this purpose and, as in the case of the termination itself, any one of the minority who does not join in the further grant is nevertheless bound by it.An important limitation on the rights of a copyright owner under a terminated grant is specified in section 203(b)(1). This clause provides that, notwithstanding a termination, a derivative work prepared earlier may \u201ccontinue to be utilized\u201d under the conditions of the terminated grant; the clause adds, however, that this privilege is not broad enough to permit the preparation of other derivative works. In other words, a film made from a play could continue to be licensed for performance after the motion picture contract had been terminated but any remake rights covered by the contract would be cut off. For this purpose, a motion picture would be considered as a \u201cderivative work\u201d with respect to every \u201cpreexisting work\u201d incorporated in it, whether the preexisting work was created independently or was prepared expressly for the motion picture.Section 203 would not prevent the parties to a transfer or license from voluntarily agreeing at any time to terminate an existing grant and negotiating a new one, thereby causing another 35-year period to start running. However, the bill seeks to avoid the situation that has arisen under the present renewal provision, in which third parties have bought up contingent future interests as a form of speculation. Section 203(b)(4) would make a further grant of rights that revert under a terminated grant valid \u201conly if it is made after the effective date of the termination.\u201d An exception, in the nature of a right of \u201cfirst refusal,\u201d would permit the original grantee or a successor of such grantee to negotiate a new agreement with the persons effecting the termination at any time after the notice of termination has been served.", "Nothing contained in this section or elsewhere in this legislation is intended to extend the duration of any license, transfer or assignment made for a period of less than thirty-five years. If, for example, an agreement provides an earlier termination date or lesser duration, or if it allows the author the right of cancelling or terminating the agreement under certain circumstances, the duration is governed by the agreement. Likewise, nothing in this section or legislation is intended to change the existing state of the law of contracts concerning the circumstances in which an author may cancel or terminate a license, transfer, or assignment.Section 203(b)(6) provides that, unless and until termination is effected under this section, the grant, \u201cif it does not provide otherwise,\u201d continues for the term of copyright. This section means that, if the agreement does not contain provisions specifying its term or duration, and the author has not terminated the agreement under this section, the agreement continues for the term of the copyright, subject to any right of termination under circumstances which may be specified therein. If, however, an agreement does contain provisions governing its duration\u2014for example, a term of fifty years\u2014and the author has not exercised his or her right of termination under the statute, the agreement will continue according to its terms\u2014in this example, for only fifty years. The quoted language is not to be construed as requiring agreements to reserve the right of termination.Editorial NotesAmendments2002\u2014Subsec. (a)(2)(A) to (C). Pub.

Recordation of transfers and other documents(a) Conditions for RecordationAny transfer of copyright ownership or other document pertaining to a copyright may be recorded in the Copyright Office if the document filed for recordation bears the actual signature of the person who executed it, or if it is accompanied by a sworn or official certification that it is a true copy of the original, signed document. A sworn or official certification may be submitted to the Copyright Office electronically, pursuant to regulatio", "ns established by the Register of Copyrights.(b) Certificate of RecordationThe Register of Copyrights shall, upon receipt of a document as provided by subsection (a) and of the fee provided by section 708, record the document and return it with a certificate of recordation.(c) Recordation as Constructive NoticeRecordation of a document in the Copyright Office gives all persons constructive notice of the facts stated in the recorded document, but only if\u2014(1) the document, or material attached to it, specifically identifies the work to which it pertains so that, after the document is indexed by the Register of Copyrights, it would be revealed by a reasonable search under the title or registration number of the work; and(2) registration has been made for the work.(d) Priority Between Conflicting TransfersAs between two conflicting transfers, the one executed first prevails if it is recorded, in the manner required to give constructive notice under subsection (c), within one month after its execution in the United States or within two months after its execution outside the United States, or at any time before recordation in such manner of the later transfer. Otherwise the later transfer prevails if recorded first in such manner, and if taken in good faith, for valuable consideration or on the basis of a binding promise to pay royalties, and without notice of the earlier transfer.(e) Priority Between Conflicting Transfer of Ownership and Nonexclusive LicenseA nonexclusive license, whether recorded or not, prevails over a conflicting transfer of copyright ownership if the license is evidenced by a written instrument signed by the owner of the rights licensed or such owner\u2019s duly authorized agent, and if\u2014(1) the license was taken before execution of the transfer; or(2) the license was taken in good faith before recordation of the transfer and without notice of it.(Pub.

Any \u201cdocument pertaining to a copyright\u201d may be recorded under subsection (a) if it \u201cbears that actual signature of the person who executed it,\u201d or if it is appropriately certified as a true copy. However, subsection (c) makes clear that the recorded document will give constructive notice of its contents only if two conditions are met: (1) the document or attached material specifically identifies the work to which it pertains so that a reasonable search under the title or registration number would reveal it, and (2) registration has been made for the work. Moreover, even though the Register of Copyrights may be compelled to accept for recordation documents that on their face appear self-serving or colorable, the Register should take care that their nature is not concealed from the public in the Copyright Office\u2019s indexing and search reports.The provisions of subsection (d), requiring recordation of transfers as a prerequisite to the institution of an infringement suit, represent a desirable change in the law. The one- and three-month grace periods provided in subsection (e) are a reasonable compromise between those who want a longer hiatus and those who argue that any grace period makes it impossible for a bona fide transferee to rely on the record at any particular time.Under subsection (f) of section 205, a nonexclusive license in writing and signed, whether recorded or not, would be valid against a later transfer, and would also prevail as against a prior unrecorded transfer if taken in good faith and without notice. Objections were raised by motion picture producers, particularly to the provision allowing unrecorded nonexclusive licenses to prevail over subsequent transfers, on the ground that a nonexclusive lic", "ense can have drastic effects on the value of a copyright. On the other hand, the impracticalities and burdens that would accompany any requirement of recordation of nonexclusive licenses outweigh the limited advantages of a statutory recordation system for them.Editorial NotesAmendments2010\u2014Subsec.
