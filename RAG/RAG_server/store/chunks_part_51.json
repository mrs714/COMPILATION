Congressional declaration of policyThe Congress finds and declares that the proliferation of nuclear explosive devices or of the direct capability to manufacture or otherwise acquire such devices poses a grave threat to the security interests of the United States and to continued international progress toward world peace and development. Recent events emphasize the urgency of this threat and the imperative need to increase the effectiveness of international safeguards and controls on peaceful nuclear activities to prevent proliferation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States to\u2014(a) actively pursue through international initiatives mechanisms for fuel supply assurances and the establishment of more effective international controls over the transfer and use of nuclear materials and equipment and nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in order to prevent proliferation, including the establishment of common international sanctions;(b) take such actions as are required to confirm the reliability of the United States in meeting its commitments to supply nuclear reactors and fuel to nations which adhere to effective non-proliferation policies by establishing procedures to facilitate the timely processing of requests for subsequent arrangements and export licenses;(c) strongly encourage nations which have not ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to do so at the earliest possible date; and(d) cooperate with foreign nations in identifying and adapting suitable technologies for energy production and, in particular, to identify alternative options to nuclear power in aiding such nations to meet their energy needs, consistent with the economic and material resources of those nations and environmental protection.(Pub.

Congressional findings and declaration of policyThe Congress finds and declares that\u2014(1) it is in the national interest for the United States Government to provide a stable source of financial support to give students in developing countries the opportunity to study in the United States, in order to improve the range and quality of educational alternatives, increase mutual understanding, and build lasting links between those countries and the United States;(2) providing scholarships to foreign students to study in the United States has proven over time to be an effective means of creating strong bonds between the United States and the future leadership of developing countries and, at the same time, assists countries substantially in their development efforts;(3) study in United States institutions by foreign students enhances trade and economic relationships by providing strong English language skills and establishing professional and business contacts;(4) students from families of limited financial means have, in the past, largely not had the opportunity to study in the United States, and scholarship programs sponsored by the United States have made no provision for identifying, preparing, or supporting such students for study in the United States;(5) it is essential that the United States citizenry develop its knowledge and understanding of the developing countries and their languages, cultures, and socioeconomic composition as these areas assume an ever larger role in the world community;(6) an undergraduate scholarship program for students o", "f limited financial means from developing countries to study in the United States would complement current assistance efforts in the areas of advanced education and training of people of developing countries in such disciplines as are required for planning and implementation of public and private development activities;(7) the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America has recommended a program of 10,000 United States Government-sponsored scholarships to bring Central American students to the United States, which program would involve careful targeting to encourage participation by young people from all social and economic classes, would maintain existing admission standards by providing intensive English and other training, and would encourage graduates to return to their home countries after completing their education; and(8) it is also in the interest of the United States, as well as peaceful cooperation in the Western Hemisphere, that particular attention be given to the students of the Caribbean region.(Pub.

I, title XCIII, \u00a7\u202f9302(b)Dec. 23, 2022136 Stat. 3882\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) A robust overseas diplomatic presence is part of an effective foreign policy, particularly in volatile environments where a flexible and timely diplomatic response can be decisive in preventing and addressing conflict.\u201c(2) Diplomats routinely put themselves and their families at great personal risk to serve their country overseas where they face threats related to international te", "rrorism, violent conflict, and public health.\u201c(3) The Department [of State] has a remarkable record of protecting personnel while enabling an enormous amount of global diplomatic activity, often in unsecure and remote places and facing a variety of evolving risks and threats. With support from Congress, the Department has revised policy, improved physical security through retrofitting and replacing old facilities, deployed additional security personnel and armored vehicles, and greatly enhanced training requirements and training facilities, including the new Foreign Affairs Security Training Center in Blackstone, Virginia.\u201c(4) Diplomatic missions rely on robust staffing and ambitious external engagement to advance United States interests as diverse as competing with China\u2019s malign influence around the world, fighting terrorism and transnational organized crime, preventing and addressing violent conflict and humanitarian disasters, promoting United States businesses and trade, protecting the rights of marginalized groups, addressing climate change, and preventing pandemic disease.\u201c(5) Efforts to protect personnel overseas have often resulted in inhibiting diplomatic activity and limiting engagement between embassy personnel and local governments and populations.\u201c(6) Given that Congress currently provides annual appropriations in excess of $1,900,000,000 for embassy security, construction, and maintenance, the Department should be able to ensure a robust overseas presence without inhibiting the ability of diplomats to\u2014\u201c(A) meet outside United States secured facilities with foreign leaders to explain, defend, and advance United States priorities;\u201c(B) understand and report on foreign political, social, and economic conditions through meeting and interacting with community officials outside of United States facilities;\u201c(C) provide United States citizen services; and\u201c(D) collaborate and, at times, compete with other diplomatic missions, particularly those, such as that of the People\u2019s Republic of China, that do not hav", "e restrictions on meeting locations.\u201c(7) Given these stakes, Congress has a responsibility to empower, support, and hold the Department accountable for implementing an aggressive strategy to ensure a robust overseas presence that mitigates potential risks and adequately considers the myriad direct and indirect consequences of a lack of diplomatic presence.\u201d \u00a7\u202f4802.

Increased participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts abroad under diplomatic security program(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) State Department policy concerning the advertising of security contracts at Foreign Service buildings has been inconsistent over the years. In many cases, diplomatic and consular posts abroad have been given the responsibility to determine the manner in which the private sector was notified concerning an invitation for bids or a request for proposals with respect to a local guard contract. Some United States foreign missions have only chosen to advertise locally the availability of a local security guard contract abroad.(2) As a result, many United States security firms that provide local guard services abroad have been unaware that local guard contracts were available for bidding abroad and such firms have been disadvantaged as a result.(3) Undoubtedly, United States security firms would be interested in bidding on more local guard contracts abroad if such firms knew of the opportunity to bid on such contracts.(b) ObjectiveIt is the objective of this section to improve the efficiency of the local guard programs abroad administered by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State and to ensure maximum competition for local guard contracts abroad concerning Foreign Service buildings.(c) Participation of United States contractors in local guard contracts ", "abroadWith respect to local guard contracts for a Foreign Service building which exceed $250,000 and are entered into after February 16, 1990(1) establish procedures to ensure that all solicitations for such contracts are adequately advertised in the Commerce and Business Daily;(2) absent compelling reasons, award such contracts through the competitive process;(3) in evaluating proposals for such contracts, award contracts to the technically acceptable firm offering the lowest evaluated price, except that proposals of United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons (as defined in subsection (d)) shall be evaluated by reducing the bid price by 10 percent;(4) in countries where contract denomination and/or payment in local currencies constitutes a barrier to competition by United States firms\u2014(A) allow solicitations to be bid in United States dollars; and(B) allow contracts awarded to United States firms to be paid in United States dollars;(5) ensure that United States diplomatic and consular posts assist United States firms in obtaining local licenses and permits; and(6) establish procedures to ensure that appropriate measures are taken by diplomatic and consular post management to assure that United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons are not disadvantaged during the solicitation and bid evaluation process.(d) DefinitionsFor the purposes of this section\u2014(1) the term \u201cUnited States person\u201d means a person which\u2014(A) is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States, including the laws of any State, locality, or the District of Columbia;(B) has its principal place of business in the United States;(C) has been incorporated or legally organized in the United States for more than 2 years before the issuance date of the invitation for bids or request for proposals with respect to the contract under subsection (c);(D) has performed within the United States or overseas security services similar in complexity to the contract being bid;(E) with respe", "ct to the contract under subsection (c), has achieved a total business volume equal to or greater than the value of the project being bid in 3 years of the 5-year period before the date specified in subparagraph (C);(F)(i) employs United States citizens in at least 80 percent of its principal management positions in the United States; and(ii) employs United States citizens in more than half of its permanent, full-time positions in the United States; and(G) has the existing technical and financial resources in the United States to perform the contract;(2) the term \u201cqualified United States joint venture person\u201d means a joint venture in which a United States person or persons owns at least 51 percent of the assets of the joint venture;(3) the term \u201cForeign Service building\u201d means any building or grounds of the United States which is in a foreign country and is under the jurisdiction and control of the Secretary of State, including residences of United States personnel assigned overseas under the authority of the Ambassador; and(4) the term \u201cbarrier to local competition\u201d means\u2014(A) conditions of extreme currency volatility;(B) restrictions on repatriation of profits;(C) multiple exchange rates which significantly disadvantage United States firms;(D) government restrictions inhibiting the free convertibility of foreign exchange; or(E) conditions of extreme local political instability.(e) United States minority contractorsNot less than 10 percent of the amount of funds obligated for local guard contracts for Foreign Service buildings subject to subsection (c) shall be allocated to the extent practicable for contracts with United States minority small business contractors.(f) United States small business contractorsNot less than 10 percent of the amount of funds obligated for local guard contracts for Foreign Service buildings subject to subsection (c) shall be allocated to the extent practicable for contracts with United States small business contractors.(g) Limitation of subcontractingWith respect to local guard contra", "cts subject to subsection (c), a prime contractor may not subcontract more than 50 percent of the total value of its contract for that project.(h) Award of local guard and protective service contractsIn evaluating proposals for local guard contracts under this section, the Secretary of State may award such contracts on the basis of best value as determined by a cost-technical tradeoff analysis (as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation part 15.101) and, with respect to such contracts for posts that are not high risk, high threat posts (as such term is defined in section 4803 of this title(Pub.

Despite the havoc wreaked upon the embassies, staff in ", "both embassies provided rapid response in locating and rescuing victims, providing emergency assistance, and quickly restoring embassy operations during a crisis.\u201c(3) The bombs are believed to have been set by individuals associated with Osama bin Laden, leader of a known transnational terrorist organization. In February 1998, bin Laden issued a directive to his followers that called for attacks against United States interests anywhere in the world.\u201c(4) Threats continue to be made against United States diplomatic facilities.\u201c(5) Accountability Review Boards were convened following the bombings, as required by Public Law 99\u2013399\u201c(6) The conclusions of the Crowe panels were strikingly similar to those stated by the Commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, which issued an extensive embassy security report in 1985.\u201c(7) The Crowe panels issued a report setting out many problems with security at United States diplomatic facilities, in particular the following:\u201c(A) The United States Government has devoted inadequate resources to security against terrorist attacks.\u201c(B) The United States Government places too low a priority on security concerns.\u201c(8) The result has been a failure to take adequate steps to prevent tragedies such as the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.\u201c(9) The Crowe panels found that there was an institutional failure on the part of the Department of State to recognize threats posed by transnational terrorism and vehicular bombs.\u201c(10) Responsibility for ensuring adequate resources for security programs is widely shared throughout the United States Government, including Congress. Unless the vulnerabilities identified by the Crowe panels are addressed in a sustained and financially realistic manner, the lives and safety of United States employees in diplomatic facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist attacks.\u201c(11) Although service in the Foreign Service or other United States Government positions abroad can never be completely without risk, the United States Government must take all re", "asonable steps to minimize security risks.\u201dAuthorizations of AppropriationsPub.

Findings; determinations(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) Middle East terrorism accounted for 60 percent of total international terrorism in 1985;(2) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the \u201cPLO\u201d) was directly responsible for the murder of ", "an American citizen on the Achille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, and a member of the PLO\u2019s Executive Committee is under indictment in the United States for the murder of that American citizen;(3) the head of the PLO has been implicated in the murder of a United States Ambassador overseas;(4) the PLO and its constituent groups have taken credit for, and been implicated in, the murders of dozens of American citizens abroad;(5) the PLO covenant specifically states that \u201carmed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine, thus it is an overall strategy, not merely a tactical phase\u201d;(6) the PLO rededicated itself to the \u201ccontinuing struggle in all its armed forms\u201d at the Palestine National Council meeting in April 1987; and(7) the Attorney General has stated that \u201cvarious elements of the Palestine Liberation Organization and its allies and affiliates are in the thick of international terror\u201d.(b) DeterminationsTherefore, the Congress determines that the PLO and its affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat to the interests of the United States, its allies, and to international law and should not benefit from operating in the United States.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) the macroeconomic policies, including the exchange rate policies, of the leading industrialized nations require improved coordination and are not consistent with long-term economic growth and financial stability;(2) currency values have a major role in determining the patterns of production and trade in the world economy;(3) the rise in the value of the dollar in the early 1980\u2019s contributed substantially to our current trade deficit;(4) exchange rates among major trading nations have become increasingly volatile and a pattern of exchange rates has at times developed which contribute to substantial and persistent imbalances in the flow of goods and services between nations, imposing serious strains on the world trading system and frustrating both business and government planning;(5) capital flows between nations have become very large compared to trade flows, respond at times quickly and dramatically to policy and economic changes, and, for these reasons, contribute significantly to uncertainty in financial markets, the volatility of exchange rates, and the development of exchange rates which produce imbalances in the flow of goods and services between nations;(6) policy initiatives by some major trading nations that manipulate the value of their currencies in relation to the United States dollar to gain competitive advantage continue to create serious com", "petitive problems for United States industries;(7) a more stable exchange rate for the dollar at a level consistent with a more appropriate and sustainable balance in the United States current account should be a major focus of national economic policy;(8) procedures for improving the coordination of macroeconomic policy need to be strengthened considerably; and(9) under appropriate circumstances, intervention by the United States in foreign exchange markets as part of a coordinated international strategic intervention effort could produce more orderly adjustment of foreign exchange markets and, in combination with necessary macroeconomic policy changes, assist adjustment toward a more appropriate and sustainable balance in current accounts.(Pub.

Statement of policyIt is the policy of the United States that\u2014(1) the United States and the other major industrialized countries should take steps to continue the process of coordinating monetary, fiscal, and structural policies initiated in the Plaza Agreement of September 1985;(2) the goal of the United States in international economic negotiations should be to achieve macroeconomic policies and exchange rates consistent with more appropriate and sustainable balances in trade and capital flows and to foster price stability in conjunction with economic growth;(3) the United States, in close coordination with the other major industrialized countries should, where appropriate, participate in international currency markets with the objective of producing more orderly adjustment of foreign exchange markets and, in combination with necessary macroeconomic policy changes, assisting adjustment toward a more appropriate and sustainable balance in current accounts; and(4) the accountability of the President for the impact of economic policies and exchange rates on trade competitiveness should be increased.(Pub.

International negotiations on exchange r", "ate and economic policies(a) Multilateral negotiationsThe President shall seek to confer and negotiate with other countries\u2014(1) to achieve\u2014(A) better coordination of macroeconomic policies of the major industrialized nations; and(B) more appropriate and sustainable levels of trade and current account balances, and exchange rates of the dollar and other currencies consistent with such balances; and(2) to develop a program for improving existing mechanisms for coordination and improving the functioning of the exchange rate system to provide for long-term exchange rate stability consistent with more appropriate and sustainable current account balances.(b) Bilateral negotiationsThe Secretary of the Treasury shall analyze on an annual basis the exchange rate policies of foreign countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the United States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade. If the Secretary considers that such manipulation is occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take action to initiate negotiations with such foreign countries on an expedited basis, in the International Monetary Fund or bilaterally, for the purpose of ensuring that such countries regularly and promptly adjust the rate of exchange between their currencies and the United States dollar to permit effective balance of payments adjustments and to eliminate the unfair advantage. The Secretary shall not be required to initiate negotiations in cases where such negotiations would have a serious detrimental impact on vital national economic and security interests; in such cases, the Secretary shall inform the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, a", "nd Urban Affairs of the Senate and of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives of his determination.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) the international debt problem threatens the safety and soundness of the international financial system, the stability of the international trading system, and the economic development of the debtor countries;(2) orderly reduction of international trade imbalances requires very substantial growth in all parts of the world economy, particularly in the developing countries;(3) growth in developing countries with substantial external debts has been significantly constrained over the last several years by a combination of high debt service obligations and insufficient new flows of financial resources to these countries;(4) substantial interest payment outflows from debtor countries, combined with inadequate net new capital inflows, have produced a significant net transfer of financial resources from debtor to creditor countries;(5) negative resource transfers at present levels severely depress both investment and growth in the debtor countries, and force debtor countries to reduce imports and expand exports in order to meet their debt service obligations;(6) current adjustment policies in debtor countries, which depress domestic demand and increase production for export, help to depress world commodity prices and limit the growth of export markets for United States industries;(7) the United States has borne a disproportionate share of ", "the burden of absorbing increased exports from debtor countries, while other industrialized countries have increased their imports from developing countries only slightly;(8) current approaches to the debt problem should not rely solely on new lending as a solution to the debt problem, and should focus on other financing alternatives including a reduction in current debt service obligations;(9) new international mechanisms to improve the management of the debt problem and to expand the range of financing options available to developing countries should be explored; and(10) industrial countries with strong current account surpluses have a disproportionate share of the world\u2019s capital resources, and bear an additional responsibility for contributing to a viable long-term solution to the debt problem.(Pub.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The threat of biological weapons and their proliferation is one of the greatest national security threats facing the United States.\u201c(2) The threat of biological weapons and materials represents a serious and increasing danger to people around the world.\u201c(3) Biological weapons are relatively inexpensive to produce, can be made with readily available expertise and equipment, do not require much space to make and can therefore be readily concealed, do not require unusual raw materials or materials not readily available for legitimate purposes, do not require the maintenance of stockpiles, or can be delivered with low-technology mechanisms, and can effect widespread casualties even in small quantities.\u201c(4) Unlike other weapons of mass destruction, biological materials capable of use as weapons can occur naturally in the environment and are also used for medicinal or other beneficial purposes.\u201c(5) Biological weapons are morally reprehensible, prompting the United States Government to halt its offensive biological weapons program in 1969, subsequently destroy its entire biological weapons arsenal, and maintain henceforth only a robust defensive capacity.\u201c(6) The Senate gave its advice and consent to ratification of the Biological Weapons Convention in 1974.\u201c(7) The Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency explained, at the time of the Senate\u2019s consideration of the Biological Weapons Convention, that the treaty contained no verification provisions because verification would be \u2018difficult\u2019.\u201c(8) A compliance protocol has now been proposed to strengthen the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.\u201c(9) The resources needed to produce, stockpile, and store biological weapons are the same as those used i", "n peaceful industry facilities to discover, develop, and produce medicines.\u201c(10) The raw materials of biological agents are difficult to use as an indicator of an offensive military program because the same materials occur in nature or can be used to produce a wide variety of products.\u201c(11) Some biological products are genetically manipulated to develop new commercial products, optimizing production and ensuring the integrity of the product, making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate commercial activities and offensive military activities.\u201c(12) Only a small culture of a biological agent and some growth medium are needed to produce a large amount of biological agents with the potential for offensive purposes.\u201c(13) The United States pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are a national asset and resource that contribute to the health and well-being of the American public as well as citizens around the world.\u201c(14) One bacterium strain can represent a large proportion of a company\u2019s investment in a pharmaceutical product and thus its potential loss during an arms control monitoring activity could conceivably be worth billions of dollars.\u201c(15) Biological products contain proprietary genetic information.\u201c(16) The proposed compliance regime for the Biological Weapons Convention entails new data reporting and investigation requirements for industry.\u201c(17) A compliance regime which contributes to the control of biological weapons and materials must have a reasonable chance of success in reducing the risk of production, stockpiling, or use of biological weapons while protecting the reputations, intellectual property, and confidential business information of legitimate companies.\u201cSEC. 1124.

These trial investigations and trial visits shall be conducted at such sites as United States Government facilities, installations, and national laboratories.\u201c(b) United States Industry Trial Investigations and Trial VisitsThe President shall take all appropriate steps to conduct or sponsor a series of United States industry trial investigations and trial visits, both during and following negotiations to develop a compliance protocol to t", "he Biological Weapons Convention, with the objective of ensuring that the compliance procedures of the protocol are effective and adequately protect the national security and the concerns of affected United States industries and research institutions.

The Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall add to the report required by subsection (d)(2) a classified annex containing an assessment of the risk to proprietary and classified information posed by any investigation or visit procedures in the compliance protocol.\u201c(d) Study.\u2014\u201c(1) In generalThe President shall conduct a study on the need for investigations and visits under the compliance protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention, including\u2014\u201c(A) an assessment of risks to national security and United States industry and research institutions of such on-site activities; and\u201c(B) an assessment of the monitoring results that can be expected from such investigations and visits.\u201c(2) ReportNot later than the date on which a compliance protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention is submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification, the President shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of ", "the Senate a report, in both unclassified and classified form, setting forth\u2014\u201c(A) the findings of the study conducted pursuant to paragraph (1); and\u201c(B) the results of trial investigations and trial visits conducted pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).\u201d \u00a7\u202f5602.

This role is reflected in strong economic, cultural, and other ties with the United States that give the United States a strong interest in the continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong.(5) Support for democratization is a fundamental principle of United States foreign policy. As such, it naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong Kong. This will remain equally true after June 30, 1997(6) The human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of great importance to the United States and are directly relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong. A fully successful transition in the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong mu", "st safeguard human rights in and of themselves.

Under this law, the people of Hong Kong may face life in prison for what China considers to be acts of secession or subversion of state power\u2014which may include acts like last year\u2019s widespread anti-government protests. The right to trial by jury may be suspended. Proceedings may be conducted in secret. China has given itself broad power to initiate and control the prosecutions of the people of Hong Kong through the new Office for Safeguarding National Security. At the same time, the law allows foreigners to be expelled if China merely suspects them of violating the law, potentially making it harder for journalists, human rights organizations, and other outside groups to hold the PRC accountable for its treatment of the people of Hong Kong.I therefore determine that the situation with respect to Hong Kong, including recent actions taken by the PRC to fundamental", "ly undermine Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law clarify certain obligations and promises that the Government of China has made with respect to the future of Hong Kong.\u201c(2) The obligations of the Government of China under the Joint Declaration were codified in a legally-binding treaty, signed by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and registered with the United Nations.\u201c(3) The obligations of the Government of China under the Basic Law originate from the Joint Declaration, were passed into the domestic law of China by the National People\u2019s Congress, and are widely considered by citizens of Hong Kong as part of the de facto legal constitution of Hong Kong.\u201c(4) Foremost among the obligations of the Government of China to Hong Kong is the promise that, pursuant to Paragraph 3b of the Joint Declaration, \u2018the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs which are the responsibilities of the Central People\u2019s Government\u2019.\u201c(5) The obligation specified in Paragraph 3b of the Joint Declaration is referenced, reinforced, and extrapolated on in several portions of the Basic Law, including Articles 2, 12, 13, 14, and 22.\u201c(6) Article 22 of the Basic Law establishes that \u2018No depar", "tment of the Central People\u2019s Government and no province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government may interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region administers on its own in accordance with this Law.\u2019.\u201c(7) The Joint Declaration and the Basic Law make clear that additional obligations shall be undertaken by China to ensure the \u2018high degree of autonomy\u2019 of Hong Kong.\u201c(8) Paragraph 3c of the Joint Declaration states, as reinforced by Articles 2, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 22 of the Basic Law, that Hong Kong \u2018will be vested with executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication\u2019.\u201c(9) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (8) of this section, including the following:\u201c(A) In 1999, the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress overruled a decision by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal on the right of abode.\u201c(B) On multiple occasions, the Government of Hong Kong, at the advice of the Government of China, is suspected to have not allowed persons entry into Hong Kong allegedly because of their support for democracy and human rights in Hong Kong and China.\u201c(C) The Liaison Office of China in Hong Kong has, despite restrictions on interference in the affairs of Hong Kong as detailed in Article 22 of the Basic Law\u2014\u201c(i) openly expressed support for candidates in Hong Kong for Chief Executive and Legislative Council;\u201c(ii) expressed views on various policies for the Government of Hong Kong and other internal matters relating to Hong Kong; and\u201c(iii) on April 17, 2020\u201c(D) The National People\u2019s Congress has passed laws requiring Hong Kong to pass laws banning disrespectful treatment of the national flag and national anthem of China.\u201c(E) The State Council of China released a white paper on June 10, 2014\u201c(F) The Government of China has directed operatives to kidnap and bring to the mainland, or is otherwise respon", "sible for the kidnapping of, residents of Hong Kong, including businessman Xiao Jianhua and bookseller Gui Minhai.\u201c(G) The Government of Hong Kong, acting with the support of the Government of China, introduced an extradition bill that would have permitted the Government of China to request and enforce extradition requests for any individual present in Hong Kong, regardless of the legality of the request or the degree to which it compromised the judicial independence of Hong Kong.\u201c(H) The spokesman for the Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress said, \u2018Whether Hong Kong\u2019s laws are consistent with the Basic Law can only be judged and decided by the National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee. No other authority has the right to make judgments and decisions.\u2019.\u201c(10) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration states, as reinforced by Article 5 of the Basic Law, that the \u2018current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged, as so will the life-style.\u2019.\u201c(11) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (10) of this section, including the following:\u201c(A) In 2002, the Government of China pressured the Government of Hong Kong to introduce \u2018patriotic\u2019 curriculum in primary and secondary schools.\u201c(B) The governments of China and Hong Kong proposed the prohibition of discussion of Hong Kong independence and self-determination in primary and secondary schools, which infringes on freedom of speech.\u201c(C) The Government of Hong Kong mandated that Mandarin, and not the native language of Cantonese, be the language of instruction in Hong Kong schools.\u201c(D) The governments of China and Hong Kong agreed to a daily quota of mainland immigrants to Hong Kong, which is widely believed by citizens of Hong Kong to be part of an effort to \u2018mainlandize\u2019 Hong Kong.\u201c(12) Paragraph 3e of the Joint Declaration states, as reinforced by Articles 4, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32[,] 33, 34, and 39 of the Basic Law, tha", "t the \u2018rights and freedoms, including those of person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief will be ensured by law\u2019 in Hong Kong.\u201c(13) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (12) of this section, including the following:\u201c(A) On February 26, 2003\u201c(B) The Liaison Office of China in Hong Kong has pressured businesses in Hong Kong not to advertise in newspapers and magazines critical of the governments of China and Hong Kong.\u201c(C) The Hong Kong Police Force selectively blocked demonstrations and protests expressing opposition to the governments of China and Hong Kong or the policies of those governments.\u201c(D) The Government of Hong Kong refused to renew [a] work visa for a foreign journalist, allegedly for hosting a speaker from the banned Hong Kong National Party.\u201c(E) The Justice Department of Hong Kong selectively prosecuted cases against leaders of the Umbrella Movement, while failing to prosecute police officers accused of using excessive force during the protests in 2014.\u201c(F) On April 18, 2020August 18, 2019\u201c(14) Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law assert that the selection of Chief Executive and all members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong should be by \u2018universal suffrage.\u2019.\u201c(15) On multiple occasions, the Government of China has undertaken actions that have contravened the letter or intent of the obligation described in paragraph (14) of this section, including the following:\u201c(A) In 2004, the National People\u2019s Congress created new, antidemocratic procedures restricting the adoption of universal suffrage for the election of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.\u201c(B) The decision by the National People\u2019s Congress on December 29, 2007\u201c(C) The decision by the National People\u2019s Congress on August 31, 2014\u201c(D) On November 7, 2016\u201c(E) In 2018, the Government of Hong", " Kong banned the Hong Kong National Party and blocked the candidacy of pro-democracy candidates.\u201c(16) The ways in which the Government of China, at times with the support of a subservient Government of Hong Kong, has acted in contravention of its obligations under the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, as set forth in this section, are deeply concerning to the people of Hong Kong, the United States, and members of the international community who support the autonomy of Hong Kong. \u201cSEC. 4.

FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) recent developments in Russia and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union present an historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful and stable international order and the integration of the independent states of the former Soviet Union into the community of democratic nations;(2) the entire international community has a vital interest in the success of this transition, and the dimension of the problems now faced in the independent states of the former Soviet Union makes it imperative for donor countries and institutions to provide the expertise and support necessary to ensure continued progress on economic and political reforms;(3) the United States is especially well-positioned because of its heritage and traditions to make a substantial contribution to this transition by building on current technical cooperation, medical, and food assistance programs, by assisting in the development of democratic institutions, and by fostering conditions that will encourage the United States business community to engage in trade and investment;(4) failure to meet the opportunities presented by these developments could threaten United States national security interests and jeopardize substantial savings in United States defense that these developments have made possible;(5) the independent states of the former Soviet Union face unprecedented environmental problems that jeopardize the quality of life and the very existence of not only their own peoples but also the peoples of", " other countries, and it is incumbent on the international community to assist the independent states in addressing these problems and in promoting sustainable use of resources and development;(6) the success of United States assistance for the independent states of the former Soviet Union depends on\u2014(A) effective coordination of United States efforts with similar activities of friendly and allied donor countries and of international financial institutions, and(B) reciprocal commitments by the governments of the independent states to work toward the creation of democratic institutions and an environment hospitable to foreign investment based upon the rule of law, including negotiation of bilateral and multilateral agreements on open trade and investment, adoption of commercial codes, establishment of transparency in regulatory and other governmental decision making, and timely payment of obligations carried over from previous governmental entities; and(7) trade and investment opportunities in the independent states of the former Soviet Union will generate employment and other economic benefits for the United States as the economies of the independent states of the former Soviet Union begin to realize their enormous potential as both customers and suppliers.(Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012\u2019.\u201cSEC. 402. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) The United States aspires to a mutually beneficial relationship with the Russian Federation based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, and supports the people of the Russian Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\u201c(2) The Russian Federation\u2014\u201c(A) is a member of the United Na", "tions, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the International Monetary Fund;\u201c(B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption; and\u201c(C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights.\u201c(3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of international agreements and treaties, which must be observed in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the international order. Human rights are an integral part of international law, and lie at the foundation of the international order. The protection of human rights, therefore, particularly in the case of a country that has incurred obligations to protect human rights under an international agreement to which it is a party, is not left exclusively to the internal affairs of that country.\u201c(4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are instrumental in the protection of human rights and in achieving sustainable economic growth, which benefits both the people of the Russian Federation and the international community through the creation of open and transparent markets.\u201c(5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights protections. This is the case when public officials are allowed to abuse their authority with impunity for political or financial gains in collusion with private entities.\u201c(6) The Russian nongovernmental organization INDEM has estimated that bribes by individuals and businesses in the Russian Federation amount to hundreds of billions of dollars a year, an increasing share of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\u201c(7) Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009\u201c(8) On July 6, 2011\u201c(9) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his repressive arrest and torture i", "n custody by officers of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation that Mr. Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of funds from the Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 companies from his client, Hermitage Capital Management, reflects how deeply the protection of human rights is affected by corruption.\u201c(10) The politically motivated nature of the persecution of Mr. Magnitsky is demonstrated by\u2014\u201c(A) the denial by all state bodies of the Russian Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. Magnitsky during the nearly 12 full months he was kept without trial in detention; and\u201c(B) the impunity since his death of state officials he testified against for their involvement in corruption and the carrying out of his repressive persecution.\u201c(11) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow for the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places of Forced Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law to independently monitor prison conditions, concluded on December 29, 2009\u201c(12) Sergei Magnitsky\u2019s experience, while particularly illustrative of the negative effects of official corruption on the rights of an individual citizen, appears to be emblematic of a broader pattern of disregard for the numerous domestic and international human rights commitments of the Russian Federation and impunity for those who violate basic human rights and freedoms.\u201c(13) The second trial, verdict, and sentence against former Yukos executives Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev evoke serious concerns about the right to a fair trial and the independence of the judiciary in the Russian Federation. The lack of credible charges, intimidation of witnesses, violations of due process and procedural norms, falsification or withholding of documents, denial of attorney-client privilege, and illegal detention in the Yukos case are highly troubling. The Council of Europe, Freedom House, and Amnesty International, among others, have concluded that they were charged and imprisoned in a process that did ", "not follow the rule of law and was politically influenced. Furthermore, senior officials of the Government of the Russian Federation, including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, have acknowledged that the arrest and imprisonment of Khodorkovsky were politically motivated.\u201c(14) According to Freedom House\u2019s 2011 report entitled \u2018The Perpetual Battle: Corruption in the Former Soviet Union and the New EU Members\u2019, \u2018[t]he highly publicized cases of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer who died in pretrial detention in November 2009 after exposing a multimillion-dollar fraud against the Russian taxpayer, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed business magnate and regime critic who was sentenced at the end of 2010 to remain in prison through 2017, put an international spotlight on the Russian state\u2019s contempt for the rule of law *\u2000*\u2000*. By silencing influential and accomplished figures such as Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky, the Russian authorities have made it abundantly clear that anyone in Russia can be silenced.\u2019.\u201c(15) The tragic and unresolved murders of Nustap Abdurakhmanov, Maksharip Aushev, Natalya Estemirova, Akhmed Hadjimagomedov, Umar Israilov, Paul Klebnikov, Anna Politkovskaya, Saihadji Saihadjiev, and Magomed Y. Yevloyev, the death in custody of Vera Trifonova, the disappearances of Mokhmadsalakh Masaev and Said-Saleh Ibragimov, the torture of Ali Israilov and Islam Umarpashaev, the near-fatal beatings of Mikhail Beketov, Oleg Kashin, Arkadiy Lander, and Mikhail Vinyukov, and the harsh and ongoing imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Alexei Kozlov, Platon Lebedev, and Fyodor Mikheev further illustrate the grave danger of exposing the wrongdoing of officials of the Government of the Russian Federation, including Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, or of seeking to obtain, exercise, defend, or promote internationally recognized human rights and freedoms.\u201c(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that the United States should continue to strongly support, and provide assistance to, the efforts of the R", "ussian people to establish a vibrant democratic political system that respects individual liberties and human rights, including by enhancing the provision of objective information through all relevant media, such as Radio Liberty and the internet.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012\u2019. \u201cSEC. 402. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) The United States aspires to a mutually beneficial relationship with the Russian Federat", "ion based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, and supports the people of the Russian Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\u201c(2) The Russian Federation\u2014\u201c(A) is a member of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and the International Monetary Fund;\u201c(B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption; and\u201c(C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in the European Convention on Human Rights.\u201c(3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect obligations and responsibilities through the adoption of international agreements and treaties, which must be observed in good faith in order to maintain the stability of the international order. Human rights are an integral part of international law, and lie at the foundation of the international order. The protection of human rights, therefore, particularly in the case of a country that has incurred obligations to protect human rights under an international agreement to which it is a party, is not left exclusively to the internal affairs of that country.\u201c(4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are instrumental in the protection of human rights and in achieving sustainable economic growth, which benefits both the people of the Russian Federation and the international community through the creation of open and transparent markets.\u201c(5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights protections. This is the case when public officials are allowed to abuse their authority with impunity for political or financial gains in collusion with private entities.\u201c(6) The Russian nongovernmental organization INDEM has estimated that bribes by individuals and businesses in the Russian Fede", "ration amount to hundreds of billions of dollars a year, an increasing share of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\u201c(7) Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009\u201c(8) On July 6, 2011\u201c(9) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his repressive arrest and torture in custody by officers of the Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation that Mr. Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of funds from the Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 companies from his client, Hermitage Capital Management, reflects how deeply the protection of human rights is affected by corruption.\u201c(10) The politically motivated nature of the persecution of Mr. Magnitsky is demonstrated by\u2014\u201c(A) the denial by all state bodies of the Russian Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. Magnitsky during the nearly 12 full months he was kept without trial in detention; and\u201c(B) the impunity since his death of state officials he testified against for their involvement in corruption and the carrying out of his repressive persecution.\u201c(11) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow for the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places of Forced Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law to independently monitor prison conditions, concluded on December 29, 2009\u201c(12) Sergei Magnitsky\u2019s experience, while particularly illustrative of the negative effects of official corruption on the rights of an individual citizen, appears to be emblematic of a broader pattern of disregard for the numerous domestic and international human rights commitments of the Russian Federation and impunity for those who violate basic human rights and freedoms.\u201c(13) The second trial, verdict, and sentence against former Yukos executives Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev evoke serious concerns about the right to a fair trial and the independence of the judiciary in the Russian Federation. The lack of credible charges, intimidation of witnesses, violations of due process and procedural norms, falsific", "ation or withholding of documents, denial of attorney-client privilege, and illegal detention in the Yukos case are highly troubling. The Council of Europe, Freedom House, and Amnesty International, among others, have concluded that they were charged and imprisoned in a process that did not follow the rule of law and was politically influenced.
