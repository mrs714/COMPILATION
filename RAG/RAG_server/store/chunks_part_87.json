Lowering Drug Prices by Putting America FirstEx. Ord. No. 13948, Sept. 13, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPurposeIn addition to being unfair, high drug prices in the United States also have serious economic and health consequences for patients in need of treatment. Hig", "h prices cause Americans to divert too much of their scarce resources to pharmaceutical treatments and away from other productive uses. High prices are also a reason many patients skip doses of their medications, take less than the recommended doses, or abandon treatment altogether. The consequences of these behaviors can be severe. For example, patients may develop acute conditions that result in poor clinical outcomes or that require drastic and expensive medical interventions.In most markets, the largest buyers pay the lowest prices, but this has not been true for prescription drugs. The Federal Government is the largest payer for prescription drugs in the world, but it pays more than many smaller buyers, including other developed nations. When the Federal Government purchases a drug covered by Medicare\u2014the cost of which is shared by American seniors who take the drug and American taxpayers\u2014it should insist on, at a minimum, the lowest price at which the manufacturer sells that drug to any other developed nation.Sec.Policy(b) The \u201cmost-favored-nation price\u201d shall mean the lowest price, after adjusting for volume and differences in national gross domestic product, for a pharmaceutical product that the drug manufacturer sells in a member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that has a comparable per-capita gross domestic product.Sec.Payment Model on the Most-Favored-Nation Price in Medicare Part BSec.Payment Model on the Most-Favored-Nation Price in Medicare Part Dsection 1315a(b)(2)(A) of title 42Sec.Revocation of Executive OrderJuly 24, 2020Sec.General Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right o", "r benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDonald J.

SGR reform legislation provides such an opportunity, but not until next year. In order to facilitate such reform, Congress finds that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should continue to focus its efforts on the following areas:\u201c(1) Simplify and reduce administrative burden on physiciansThe application and assessment of measures and other activities under SGR reform should be facilitated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in a way that accounts for the administrative burden such measurement places on physicians. Therefore, the Congress encourages CMS to identify and implement, to the extent practicable, mechanisms to ensure that the application and assessment of measures be coordinated across programs.\u201c(2) Timely feedback for physiciansIn order for measure and assessment programs to encourage the highest quality care for Medicare seniors, the Congress finds it critical that CMS provide physicians with feedback on performance in as close to real time as possible. Such timely feedback will ensure that physicians can excel under a system of meaningful measurement.\u201c(3) Encourage development of new modelsThere is great need to test alternatives to Fee-For-Service reimbursement in the Medicare program. One option is the promotion and adoption of new models of care for physicians. To date, there has been significant development and testing of models for primary care. Congress supports these efforts and encourages them to continue in the future. Congress also encourages the development and testing of models of specialty care.\u201dImplementation of 2010 AmendmentPub.
