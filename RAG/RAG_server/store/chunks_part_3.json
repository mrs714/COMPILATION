Wage-board overtime and Sunday rates; computation(a) An employee whose pay is fixed and adjusted from time to time in accordance with prevailing rates under section 5343 or 5349 of this title, or by a wage board or similar administrative authority serving the same purpose, is entitled to overtime pay for overtime work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week. However, an employee subject to this subsection who regularly is required to remain at or within the confines of his post of duty in excess of 8 hours a day in a standby or on-call status is en", "titled to overtime pay only for hours of duty, exclusive of eating and sleeping time, in excess of 40 a week. The overtime hourly rate of pay is computed as follows:(1) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a basis other than an annual or monthly basis, multiply the basic hourly rate of pay by not less than one and one-half.(2) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on an annual basis, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,087, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.(3) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a monthly basis, multiply the basic monthly rate of pay by 12 to derive a basic annual rate of pay, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,087, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.An employee subject to this subsection whose regular work schedule includes an 8-hour period of service a part of which is on Sunday is entitled to additional pay at the rate of 25 percent of his hourly rate of basic pay for each hour of work performed during that 8-hour period of service. For employees serving outside the United States in areas where Sunday is a routine workday and another day of the week is officially recognized as the day of rest and worship, the Secretary of State may designate the officially recognized day of rest and worship as the day with respect to which the preceding sentence shall apply instead of Sunday. Time spent in a travel status away from the official duty station of an employee subject to this subsection is not hours of work unless the travel (i) involves the performance of work while traveling, (ii) is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while traveling, (iii) is carried out under arduous conditions, or (iv) results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively (including travel by the employee to such event and the return of the employee from such event to the employee\u2019s official duty station). The first and third sentences of this subsection shall not be applicable to an employee who is", " subject to the overtime pay provisions of section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. In the case of an employee who would, were it not for the preceding sentence, be subject to the first and third sentences of this subsection, the Office of Personnel Management shall by regulation prescribe what hours shall be deemed to be hours of work and what hours of work shall be deemed to be overtime hours for the purpose of such section 7 so as to ensure that no employee receives less pay by reason of the preceding sentence.(b) An employee under the Office of the Architect of the Capitol who is paid on a daily or hourly basis and who is not subject to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title is entitled to overtime pay for overtime work in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The overtime hourly rate of pay is computed in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section.(c) The provisions of this section, including the last two sentences of subsection (a) and the provisions of section 5543(b), shall apply to a prevailing rate employee described in section 5342(a)(2)(B).(Pub.

Night, standby, irregular, and hazardous duty differential(a) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, nightwork is regularly scheduled work between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and includes\u2014(1) periods of absence with pay during these hours due to holidays; and(2) periods of leave with pay during these hours if the periods of leave with pay during a pay period total less than 8 hours.Except as otherwise provided by subsection (c) of this section, an employee is entitled to pay for nightwork at his rate of basic pay plus premium pay amounting to 10 percent of that basic rate. This subsection and subsection (b) of this section do not modify section 5141 of title 31(b) The head of an agency may designate a time after 6:00 p.m. and a time before 6:00 a.m. as the beginning and end, respectively, of nightwork for the purpose of subsection (a) of this section, at a post outside the United States where the customary hours of business extend into the hours of nightwork provided by subsection (a) of this section.(c) The head of an agency, with the approval of the Office of Personnel Management, may provide that\u2014(1) an employee in a position requiring him regularly to remain at, or within the confines of, his station during longer than ordinary periods of duty, a substantial part of which consists of remaining in a standby status rather than performing work, shall receive premium pay for this duty on an annual basis instead of premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter, except for irregular, unscheduled overtime duty in excess of his regularly scheduled weekly tour. Premium pay under this paragraph is determined as an appropriate percentage, not in excess of 25 percent, of such part of the rate of basic pay for the position as does not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS\u201310 (including any applicable locality-based c", "omparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law and any applicable special rate of pay under section 5305 or similar provision of law) (or, for a position described in section 5542(a)(3) of this title(2) an employee in a position in which the hours of duty cannot be controlled administratively, and which requires substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty with the employee generally being responsible for recognizing, without supervision, circumstances which require the employee to remain on duty, shall receive premium pay for this duty on an annual basis instead of premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter, except for regularly scheduled overtime, night, and Sunday duty, and for holiday duty. Premium pay under this paragraph is an appropriate percentage, not less than 10 percent nor more than 25 percent, of the rate of basic pay for the position, as determined by taking into consideration the frequency and duration of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty required in the position.(d) The Office shall establish a schedule or schedules of pay differentials for duty involving unusual physical hardship or hazard, and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Under such regulations as the Office may prescribe, and for such minimum periods as it determines appropriate, an employee to whom chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title applies is entitled to be paid the appropriate differential for any period in which he is subjected to physical hardship or hazard not usually involved in carrying out the duties of his position. However, the pay differential\u2014(1) does not apply to an employee in a position the classification of which takes into account the degree of physical hardship or hazard involved in the performance of t", "he duties thereof, except\u2014(A) an employee in an occupational series covering positions for which the primary duties involve the prevention, control, suppression, or management of wildland fires, as determined by the Office; and(B) in such other circumstances as the Office may by regulation prescribe; and(2) may not exceed an amount equal to 25 percent of the rate of basic pay applicable to the employee.(Pub.

Broad use of flexible work arrangements to enable Federal employees to better balance their work and family responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job satisfaction, while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism. I therefore adopt the National Performance Review\u2019s recommendation that a more family-friendly workplace be created by expanding opportunities for Federal workers to participate in flexible work arrangements, consistent with the mission of the executive branch to serve the public.The head of each executive department or agency (hereafter collectively \u201cagency\u201d or \u201cagencies\u201d) is hereby directed to establish a program to encourage and support the expansion of flexible family-friendly work arrangements, including: job sharing; career part-time employment; alternative work schedules; telecommuting and satellite work locations. Such a program shall include:(1) identifying agency positions that are suitable for flexible work arrangements;(2) adopting appropriate policies to increase the opportunities for employees in suitable positions to participate in such flexible work arrangements;(3) providing appropriate training and support necessary to implement flexible work arrangements; and(4) identifying barriers to implementing this directive and providing recommendations for addressing such barriers to the President\u2019s Management Council.I direct the Dire", "ctor of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) and the Administrator of General Services (\u201cGSA\u201d) to take all necessary steps to support and encourage the expanded implementation of flexible work arrangements. The OPM and GSA shall work in concert to promptly review and revise regulations that are barriers to such work arrangements and develop legislative proposals, as needed, to achieve the goals of this directive. The OPM and GSA also shall assist agencies, as requested, to implement this directive.The President\u2019s Management Council, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget, shall ensure that any guidance necessary to implement the actions set forth in this directive is provided.Independent agencies are requested to adhere to this directive to the extent permitted by law.This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this directive in the Federal Register.\nWilliam J. Clinton.\nEnhancing Workplace Flexibilities and Work-Life ProgramsMemorandum of President of the United States, June 23, 2014Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesTo attract, empower, and retain a talented and productive workforce in the 21st century, the Federal Government must continue to make progress in enabling employees to balance their responsibilities at work and at home. We should build on our record of leadership through better education and training, expanded availability of workplace flexibilities and work-life programs, as appropriate, and improved tracking of outcomes and accountability. In doing so, we can help ensure that the Federal workforce is engaged and empowered to deliver exceptional and efficient service to the American public while meeting family and ", "other needs at home.Therefore, it is the policy of the Federal Government to promote a culture in which managers and employees understand the workplace flexibilities and work-life programs available to them and how these measures can improve agency productivity and employee engagement. The Federal Government must also identify and eliminate any arbitrary or unnecessary barriers or limitations to the use of these flexibilities and develop new strategies consistent with statute and agency mission to foster a more balanced workplace.By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to support executive departments and agencies (agencies) in their efforts to better utilize existing and develop new workplace flexibilities and work-life programs, I hereby direct as follows:SectionRight to Request Work Schedule Flexibilities(b) To facilitate conversations about work schedule flexibilities, each agency shall review, and if necessary amend or establish, procedures within 120 days of the date of this memorandum.

and(iv) that the agency should remind employees on a periodic basis of the workplace flexibilities available to them.(c) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall issue guidance to Chief Human Capital Officers regarding the requirements set forth in this section within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, and shall assist agenci", "es with implementation of this section.(d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the discretion granted to an employee\u2019s supervisor in making a decision on the request for work schedule flexibilities, in accordance with the agency\u2019s mission-related requirements.SecExpanding Access to Workplace Flexibilities(a) part-time employment and job sharing, including for temporary periods of time where appropriate;(b) alternative work schedules, including assurance that core hours are limited only to those hours that are necessary;(c) break times for nursing mothers and a private space to express milk;(d) telework;(e) annual leave and sick leave, including the advancement of leave for employee and family care situations;(f) sick leave for family care and bereavement;(g) sick leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition;(h) sick leave for adoption;(i) leave pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), including allowing employees to take their FMLA leave intermittently as allowed under the Act, including for childbirth, adoption, and foster care;(j) leave transfer programs, including leave banks;(k) bone marrow and organ donor leave;

The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees also can pose a serious health and safety threat to members of the public and to other Federal employees;The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees in certain positions evidences less than the complete reliability, stability, and good judgment that is consistent with access to sensitive information and creates the possibility of coercion, influence, and irresponsible action under pressure that may pose a serious risk to national security, the public safety, and the effective enforcement of the law; andFederal employees who use illegal drugs must themselves be primarily responsible for changing their behavior and, if necessary, begin the process of rehabilitating themselves.By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 3301(2) of Title 5section 7301 of Title 5section 290ee\u20131 of Title 42SectionDrug-Free Workplace(b) The use of illegal drugs by Federal employees, whether on duty or off duty, is contrary to the efficiency of the service.(c) Persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for Federal employment.SecAgency Responsibilities(b) Each agency plan shall include:(1) A statement of policy setting forth the agency\u2019s expectati", "ons regarding drug use and the action to be anticipated in response to identified drug use;(2) Employee Assistance Programs emphasizing high level direction, education, counseling, referral to rehabilitation, and coordination with available community resources;(3) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing illegal drug use by agency employees;(4) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with safety and security issues; and(5) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing on a controlled and carefully monitored basis in accordance with this Order.SecDrug Testing Programs(b) The head of each Executive agency shall establish a program for voluntary employee drug testing.(c) In addition to the testing authorized in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the head of each Executive agency is authorized to test an employee for illegal drug use under the following circumstances:(1) When there is a reasonable suspicion that any employee uses illegal drugs;(2) In an examination authorized by the agency regarding an accident or unsafe practice; or(3) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use through an Employee Assistance Program.(d) The head of each Executive agency is authorized to test any applicant for illegal drug use.SecDrug Testing Procedures(b) Before conducting a drug test, the agency shall inform the employee to be tested of the opportunity to submit medical documentation that may support a legitimate use for a specific drug.(c) Drug testing programs shall contain procedures for timely submission of requests for retention of records and specimens; procedures for retesting; and procedures, consistent with applicable law, to protect the confidentiality of test results and related medical and rehabilitation records.

Although the Federal Government has made progress in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses in recent years, its workers (excluding those employed by the U.S. Postal Service) still filed more than 79,000 new claims and received over $1.6 billion in workers\u2019 compensation payments in fiscal year 2009. Many of these work-related injuries and illnesses are preventable, and executive departments and agencies can and should do even more to improve workplace safety and health, reduce the financial burden of injury on taxpayers, and relieve unnecessary suffering by workers and their families.Therefore, I am establishing a 4-year Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (POWER) Initiative, covering fiscal years 2011 through 2014. The POWER Initiative will extend prior workplace safety and health efforts of the Federal Government by setting more aggressive performance targets, encouraging the collection and analysis of data on the causes and consequences of frequent or severe injury and illness, and prioritizing safety and health management programs that have proven effective in the past.Under the POWER Initiative, each executive department and agency will be expected to improve its performance in seven areas:(i) reducing total injury and illness case rates;(ii) reducing lost time injury and illness case rates;(iii) analyzing lost time injury and illness data;(iv) increasing the timely filing of workers\u2019 compensation claims;(v) increasing the timely filing of wage-loss claims;(vi) reducing lost production day rates; and(vii) speeding employees\u2019 return to work in cases of serious injury or illness.Executive departments and agencies (except the U.S. Postal Service) shall coordinate with the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs to establis", "h performance targets in each category. The Secretary of Labor shall lead the POWER Initiative by measuring both Government-wide and agency-level performance and reporting to me annually.Each executive department and agency shall bear its own costs for participating in the POWER Initiative, and nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Secretary of Labor is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f7903.

Computation of pay(a) For the purpose of this section\u2014(1) \u201covertime pay\u201d means pay for hours of service in excess of a statutory or other basic workweek or other basic unit of worktime, as observed by the employing establishment; and(2) \u201cyear\u201d means a period of 12 calendar months, or the eq", "uivalent thereof as specified by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.(b) In computing monetary compensation for disability or death on the basis of monthly pay, that pay is determined under this section.(c) The monthly pay at the time of injury is deemed one-twelfth of the average annual earnings of the employee at that time. When compensation is paid on a weekly basis, the weekly equivalent of the monthly pay is deemed one-fifty-second of the average annual earnings. However, for so much of a period of total disability as does not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the beginning of compensable disability, the compensation, in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, may be computed on the basis of the actual daily wage of the employee at the time of injury in which event he may be paid compensation for the days he would have worked but for the injury.(d) Average annual earnings are determined as follows:(1) If the employee worked in the employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury and the employment was in a position for which an annual rate of pay\u2014(A) was fixed, the average annual earnings are the annual rate of pay; or(B) was not fixed, the average annual earnings are the product obtained by multiplying his daily wage for the particular employment, or the average thereof if the daily wage has fluctuated, by 300 if he was employed on the basis of a 6-day workweek, 280 if employed on the basis of a 5\u00bd-day week, and 260 if employed on the basis of a 5-day week.(2) If the employee did not work in employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury, but the position was one which would have afforded employment for substantially a whole year, the average annual earnings are a sum equal to the average annual earnings of an employee of the same class working substantially the whole immediately preceding year in the same or similar emplo", "yment by the United States in the same or neighboring place, as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection.(3) If either of the foregoing methods of determining the average annual earnings cannot be applied reasonably and fairly, the average annual earnings are a sum that reasonably represents the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury having regard to the previous earnings of the employee in Federal employment, and of other employees of the United States in the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring location, other previous employment of the employee, or other relevant factors. However, the average annual earnings may not be less than 150 times the average daily wage the employee earned in the employment during the days employed within 1 year immediately preceding his injury.(4) If the employee served without pay or at nominal pay, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection apply as far as practicable, but the average annual earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS\u201315. If the average annual earnings cannot be determined reasonably and fairly in the manner otherwise provided by this section, the average annual earnings shall be determined at the reasonable value of the service performed but not in excess of $3,600 a year.(e) The value of subsistence and quarters, and of any other form of remuneration in kind for services if its value can be estimated in money, and premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) of this title(1) overtime pay;(2) additional pay or allowance authorized outside the United States because of differential in cost of living or other special circumstances; or(3) bonus or premium pay for extraordinary service including bonus or pay for particularly hazardous service in time of war.(Pub.

Determination of wage-earning capacity(a) In determining compensation for partial disability, except permanent partial disability compensable under sections 8107\u20138109 of this title, the wage-earning capacity of an employee is determined by his actual earnings if his actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity. If the actual earnings of the employee do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity or if the employee has no actual earnings, his wage-earning capacity as appears reasonable under the circumstances is determined with due regard to\u2014(1) the nature of his injury;(2) the degree of physical impairment;(3) his usual employment;(4) his age;(5) his qualifications for other employment;(6) the availability of suitable employment; and(7) other factors or circumstances which may affect his wage-earning capacity in his disabled condition.(b) Section 8114(d) of this title(P", "ub.

Limitations on right to receive compensation(a) While an employee is receiving compensation under this subchapter, or if he has been paid a lump sum in commutation of installment payments until the expiration of the period during which the installment payments would have continued, he may not receive salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States, except\u2014(1) in return for service actually performed;(2) pension for service in the Army, Navy, or Air Force;(3) other benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs unless such benefits are payable for the same injury or the same death; and(4) retired pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or equivalent pay for service in the Armed Forces or other uniformed services.However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title, or another retirement system for employees of the Government, does not impair the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title(b) An individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter because of his injury, or because of the death of an employee, who also is entitled to receive from the United States under a provision of statute other than this subchapter payments or benefits for that injury or death (except proceeds of an insurance policy), because of service by him (or in the case of death, by the deceased) as an employee or in the armed forces, shall elect which benefits he will receive. The individual shall make the election within 1 year after the injury or death or within a further time allowed for g", "ood cause by the Secretary of Labor.
