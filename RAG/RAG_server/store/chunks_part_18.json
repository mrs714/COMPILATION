Except in cases covered by formula C the pertinent basic computation provisions for such retirement either provide for computation of retired pay on the same basis as the provisions dealing with higher retired grade, or the basic retirement provisions were themselves", " enacted after the provisions authorizing higher retired grade. The provisos of 10:1002 and 1005 are omitted as surplusage, since no formula for the computation of retired pay includes inactive service on the retired list as a credit.The words \u201cat rates applicable on date of retirement and adjust to reflect later changes in permanent rates\u201d, in footnote 2; and all of footnote 4; are based on the source statutes incorporated in the formulas to which footnotes 2 and 4 apply.In footnote 4, the words \u201cand disregard a part of a year that is less than six months\u201d are made applicable to formulas A\u2014E although this part of the rule is expressed only as to formula B, in 10:941a(e)(1).

When the source statute was enacted there was no class of officers exactly corresponding to officers of the present Naval Reserve, and retired officers could be called to active duty only in time of war, so that the detailing of an officer not on the active list as assistant to the bureau chief was probably not contemplated. Further, since the assistant or deputy must at times perform the duties of the chief, it is reasonable to assume that he was intended to be in the same category of officers. Later statutes relating to the Assistant Chiefs of the Bureau of Aeronautics and the Bureau of Ships, enacted at a time when there were Reserve officers and when retired officers could be called to duty at any time with their consent, specify that the assistant chiefs shall be officers on the active list.Editorial NotesPrior ProvisionsA prior section 8077, act Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 104170A Stat. 496Pub.

Prescribed number; vacancies\nIn this chapter, the term \u201cprescribed number\u201d or \u201cnumber .\u2000.\u2000. prescribed\u201d as applied to a grade, means the number of officers of a described corps, designation, or other category that shall be maintained in the grade concerned. Except as otherwise specifically provided, the actual number of officers in a grade may not exceed the prescribed number. Vacancies occur whenever, and to the extent that, the actual number falls below the prescribed number.(Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 104170A Stat. 299Pub.

A, title VIII, \u00a7\u202f807(b)(1)Aug. 13, 2018132 Stat. 1834\nHistorical and Revision NotesThis section is derived from the distribution-in-grade provisions of the Officers Personnel Act of 1947. It is inserted here to show clearly what is meant by the \u201cauthorized number\u201d of officers in a grade as used in the distribution-in-grade sections of the Officer Personnel Act. \u201cPrescribed number\u201d is substituted for \u201cauthorized number\u201d because the latter, as used in other provisions of law, means simply the maximum number of persons authorized to be in a designated category. As used in the distribution-in-grade provisions of the Officer Personnel Act the term means not only the maximum number of officers that may be in a particular grade, but also the number of officers that should be maintained in that grade. It places not only a ceiling but a floor on the number of officers for the grade concerned. This is accomplished by establishing vacancies when the actual number of officers in the grade concerned falls below the \u201cauthorized\u201d or, as used here, the \u201cprescribed\u201d number. Where there is a prescribed number for a grade, an officer should, in the absence of other controlling provisions of law, be promoted to that grade to fill an existing vacan", "cy, as of the date on which the vacancy occurred. In this manner, at least constructively, the prescribed number is maintained.There is no source for the section because the Officer Personnel Act did not attempt specifically to define \u201cauthorized number\u201d in this context. The meaning of the term is derived only from understanding the effect given it throughout the Officer Personnel Act and from the imperative requirements of sections 103, 203, and 303 of the act.Editorial NotesAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

The concept that regular grades differ from reserve grades and that a grade held under a permanent appointment differs from the grade of the same name held under a temporary appointment is foreign to the naval service. In the Navy and the Marine Corps, all officers serving, for example, in the grade of chief warrant officer, W\u20134, are considered to be serving in the same grade regardless of whether they are Regulars or Reserves and regardless of whether they are temporary or permanent officers holding temporary or permanent appointments in that grade. This section, therefore, lists the four warrant officer grades as applicable to all warrant officers of the naval service.Reference to the pay grades corresponding to the military grades is omitted as unnecessary for the purpose of this section.Editorial NotesAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

R.S. 1588 provided, inter alia, that officers so retired should received retired pay at the rate of 75 percent of the sea pay of their respective grades, but that section was expressly repealed by \u00a7\u202f531(a)(7) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, leaving no specific provision for the retired pay of officers retired under R.S. 1443. It would be absurd to assume, however, that Congress intended that an officer having 40 years of service should be retired without pay, when he could have been retired with pay at any time within the preceding 20 years. By the repeal of R.S. 1588 Congress intended merely to remove obsolete and superseded provisions as to retirement at age 62 and retirement after 45 years of service, references to sea pay, and provisions, inconsistent with later law, for half pay for officers retired for other reasons. Congress intended the retired pay of officers retired after 40 years of service to be computed accord", "ing to the formula prescribed generally for retired officers, other than for officers retired by reason of physical disability, and this section is worded accordingly.Subsection (b) is added for clarity.

The rule is derived, not from a specific provision of law, but from the fact that special legislative authority is required to recall a retired officer in any other grade.The desirability of including a positive statement of the rule is pointed up by the legislative history of the Act of February 21, 1946, ch. 34, \u00a7\u202f8(a)60 Stat. 28Act of July 24, 1941, ch. 320, \u00a7\u202f10(d)55 Stat. 60534 U.S.C. 350i(d)requiredDecember 6, 1945Section 412(a) of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 (34 U.S.C. 410n\u00a7\u202f6150 of this titleDecember 20, 1950It appears that the rule was never in doubt until after the enactment of the two recent laws cited above, one applying the rule to a limited class, and one stating a discretionary exception without stating the rule itself.

The language authorizing the Secretary, in his discretion, to nominate additional midshipmen to meet the needs of the armed services but not to exceed the authorized strength of the Academy is changed to authorize the Secretary to \u201cfill the vacancies by nominating additional midshipmen\u201d. In exercising his discretion under this subsection, these factors are necessarily considered by the Secretary, irrespective of a specific provision so instructing him.In subsection (f) the word \u201cadmission\u201d is changed to the word \u201cappointment\u201d, since the admission of a person is a consequence of, and follows automatically from, his appointment.
