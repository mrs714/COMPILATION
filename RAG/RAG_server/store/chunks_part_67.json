In 2011\u2014(A) among ", "Americans ages 16 through 64, the rate of disability was 12.1 percent;(B) among African-Americans in that age range, the disability rate was more than twice as high, at 27.1 percent; and(C) for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the same age range, the disability rate was also more than twice as high, at 27.0 percent.(3) Inequitable treatmentPatterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.(4) RecruitmentRecruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.(b) Outreach to minorities(1) In generalFor each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as the \u201cDirector\u201d) shall reserve 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII to carry out this subsection.

Congressional findings and declaration of policy(a) Benefit plans as affecting interstate commerce and the Federal taxing powerThe Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and economic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are affected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate character of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans are carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their operation, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, and to provide f", "or the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are afforded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.(b) Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciariesIt is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.(c) Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insuranceIt is hereby further declared to be the policy of this chapter to pro", "tect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.(Pub.

L. 109\u2013280Pub. L. 109\u2013280section 401 of Title 26Message of the PresidentTo the Congress of the United States:Today I am submitting to the Congress my fourth Reorganization Plan for 1978. This proposal is designed to simplify and improve the unnecessarily complex administrative requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) [see Short Title note set out under this section]. The new plan will eliminate overlap and duplication in the administration of ERISA and help us achie", "ve our goal of well regulated private pension plans.ERISA was an essential step in the protection of worker pension rights. Its administrative provisions, however, have resulted in bureaucratic confusion and have been justifiably criticized by employers and unions alike. The biggest problem has been overlapping jurisdictional authority. Under current ERISA provisions, the Departments of Treasury and Labor both have authority to issue regulations and decisions.This dual jurisdiction has delayed a good many important rulings and, more importantly, produced bureaucratic runarounds and burdensome reporting requirements.The new plan will significantly reduce these problems. In addition, both Departments are trying to cut red tape and paperwork, to eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements, and to streamline forms wherever possible.Both Departments have already made considerable progress, and both will continue the effort to simplify their rules and their forms.The Reorganization Plan is the most significant result of their joint effort to modify and simplify ERISA. It will eliminate most of the jurisdictional overlap between Treasury and Labor by making the following changes:1) Treasury will have statutory authority for minimum standards. The new plan puts all responsibility for funding, participation, and vesting of benefit rights in the Department of Treasury. These standards are necessary to ensure that employee benefit plans are adequately funded and that all beneficiary rights are protected. Treasury is the most appropriate Department to administer these provisions; however, Labor will continue to have veto power over Treasury decisions that significantly affect collectively bargained plans.2) Labor will have statutory authority for fiduciary obligations. ERISA prohibits transactions in which self-interest or conflict of interest could occur, but allows certain exemptions from these prohibitions. Labor will be responsible for overseeing fiduciary conduct under these provisions.3) Both Departments will retain e", "nforcement powers. The Reorganization Plan will continue Treasury\u2019s authority to audit plans and levy tax penalties for any deviation from standards. The plan will also continue Labor\u2019s authority to bring civil action against plans and fiduciaries. These provisions are retained in order to keep the special expertise of each Department available. New coordination between the Departments will eliminate duplicative investigations of alleged violations.This reorganization will make an immediate improvement in ERISA\u2019s administration. It will eliminate almost all of the dual and overlapping authority in the two departments and dramatically cut the time required to process applications for exemptions from prohibited transactions.This plan is an interim arrangement. After the Departments have had a chance to administer ERISA under this new plan, the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments will jointly evaluate that experience. Based on that evaluation, early in 1980, the Administration will make appropriate legislative proposals to establish a long-term administrative structure for ERISA.Each provision in this reorganization will accomplish one or more of the purposes in Title 5 of U.S.C. 901(a). There will be no change in expenditure or personnel levels, although a small number of people will be transferred from the Department of Treasury to the Department of Labor.We all recognize that the administration of ERISA has been unduly burdensome. I am confident that this reorganization will significantly relieve much of that burden.This plan is the culmination of our effort to streamline ERISA. It provides an administrative arrangement that will work.ERISA has been a symbol of unnecessarily complex government regulation. I hope this new step will become equally symbolic of my Administration\u2019s commitment to making government more effective and less intrusive in the lives of our people.\nJimmy Carter.The White HouseAugust 10, 1978\nExecutive Order No. 12071Ex.

No. 13847, Aug. 31, 2018By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyRegulatory burdens and complexity can be costly and discourage employers, especially small businesses, from offering workplace retirement plans to their employees. Businesses are sensitive to the overall expense of setting up such plans. A recent survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that 71 percent of small- and medium-sized businesses that do not offer retirement plans were deterred from doing so by high costs; 37 percent cited high costs as their main reason for not offering such a plan. Federal agencies should revise or eliminate rules and regulations that impose unnecessary costs and burdens on businesses, especially small businesses, and that hinder formation of workplace retirement plans.Expanding access to multiple employer plans (MEPs), under which employees of different private-sector employers may participate in a single retirement plan, is an efficient way to reduce administrative costs of retirement plan establishment and maintenance and would encourage more plan formation and broader availability of workplace retirement plans, especially among small employers.Similarly, reducing the number and complexity of employee benefit plan notices and disclosures currently required would ease regulatory burdens. The costs and potential liabilities for employers and plan fiduciarie", "s of complying with existing disclosure requirements may discourage plan formation or maintenance. Improving the effectiveness of required notices and disclosures and reducing their cost to employers promote retirement security by expanding access to workplace retirement plans.Outdated distribution mandates may also reduce plan effectiveness by forcing retirees to make excessively large withdrawals from their accounts\u2014potentially leaving them with insufficient savings in their later years.In light of the foregoing it shall, therefore, be the policy of the Federal Government to address these problems and promote retirement security for America\u2019s workers.SecImproving Retirement SecurityExpanding access to Multiple Employer Plans and Other Retirement Plan Options(i) The Secretary of Labor shall examine policies that would:(1) clarify and expand the circumstances under which United States employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, may sponsor or adopt a MEP as a workplace retirement option for their employees, subject to appropriate safeguards; and(2) increase retirement security for part-time workers, sole proprietors, working owners, and other entrepreneurial workers with non-traditional employer-employee relationships by expanding their access to workplace retirement plans, including MEPs.(ii) Within 180 days of the date of this order [Aug. 31, 201829 U.S.C. 1002(5)(b) Qualification Requirements for Multiple Employer Plans26 U.S.C. 1(c) Improving the Effectiveness of and Reducing the Cost of Furnishing Required Notices and DisclosuresPub.

Additional Congressional findings and declaration of policy(a) Effects of multiemployer pension plansThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;(2) multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;(3) the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly a", "ffected by multiemployer pension plans; and(4)(A) withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and(B) in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.(b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of programThe Congress further finds that\u2014(1) it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and(2) it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.(c) PolicyIt is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act\u2014(1) to foster and facilitate interstate commerce,(2) to alleviate certain problems which tend to discourage the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans,(3) to provide reasonable protection for the interests of participants and beneficiaries of financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, and(4) to provide a financially self-sufficient program for the guarantee of employee benefits under multiemployer plans.(Pub.

Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as", " of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.(D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of\u2014(i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974(ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.(E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service.

comply with the requirements of this subchapter merely because such fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its discretion, not to seek recovery of all or part of such overpayment from\u2014(A) any participant or beneficiary,(B) any plan sponsor of, or contributing employer to\u2014(i) an individual account plan, provided that the amount needed to prevent or restore any impermissible forfeiture from any participant\u2019s or beneficiary\u2019s account arising in connection with the overpayment is, separately from and independently of the overpayment, allocated to such account pursuant to the nonforfeitability requirements of section 1053 of this title(ii) a defined benefit pension plan subject to the funding rules in part 3 of this subtitle B, unless the responsible plan fiduciary determines, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, that failure to recover all or part of the overpayment faster than required under such funding rules would materially affect the plan\u2019s ability to pay benefits due to other participants and beneficiaries, or(C) any fiduciary of the plan, other than a fiduciary (including a plan sponsor or contributing employer acting in a fiduciary capacity) whose breach of its fiduciary duties resulted in such overpayment, provided that if the plan has established prudent procedures to prevent and minimize overpayment of benefits and the relevant plan fiduciaries have followed such procedures, an inadvertent benefit overpayment will not give rise to a breach of fiduciary duty.(2) Reduction in future benefit payments and recovery from responsible partyParagraph (1) shall not fail to apply with respect to any inadvertent benefit overpayment merely because, after discovering such overpayment, the responsible plan fiduciary\u2014(A) reduces future benefit payments to the correct amount provided for under the terms of the plan, or(B) seeks recovery from the person or persons responsible for the overpayment.(3) Employer funding obligationsNoth", "ing in this subsection shall relieve an employer of any obligation imposed on it to make contributions to a plan to meet the minimum funding standards under part 3 of this subtitle B or to prevent or restore an impermissible forfeiture in accordance with section 1053 of this title(4) Recoupment from participants and beneficiariesIf the responsible plan fiduciary, in the exercise of its fiduciary discretion, decides to seek recoupment from a participant or beneficiary of all or part of an inadvertent benefit overpayment made by the plan to such participant or beneficiary, it may do so, subject to the following conditions:(A) No interest or other additional amounts (such as collection costs or fees) are sought on overpaid amounts for any period.(B) If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing annuity by reducing future benefit payments\u2014(i) the reduction ceases after the plan has recovered the full dollar amount of the overpayment,(ii) the amount recouped each calendar year does not exceed 10 percent of the full dollar amount of the overpayment, and(iii) future benefit payments are not reduced to below 90 percent of the periodic amount otherwise payable under the terms of the plan.Alternatively, if the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a non-decreasing annuity through one or more installment payments, the sum of such installment payments in any calendar year does not exceed the sum of the reductions that would be permitted in such year under the preceding sentence.(C) If the plan seeks to recoup past overpayments of a benefit other than a non-decreasing annuity, the plan satisfies requirements developed by the Secretary of Labor for purposes of this subparagraph.(D) Efforts to recoup overpayments are\u2014(i) not accompanied by threats of litigation, unless the responsible plan fiduciary makes a determination that there is a reasonable likelihood of success to recover an amount greater than the cost of recovery, and(ii) not made through a collection agency or similar third party, unless the p", "articipant or beneficiary ignores or rejects efforts to recoup the overpayment following either a final judgment in Federal or State court or a settlement between the participant or beneficiary and the plan, in either case authorizing such recoupment.(E) Recoupment of past overpayments to a participant is not sought from any beneficiary of the participant, including a spouse, surviving spouse, former spouse, or other beneficiary.(F) Recoupment may not be sought if the first overpayment occurred more than 3 years before the participant or beneficiary is first notified in writing of the error, except in the case of fraud or misrepresentation by the participant.(G) A participant or beneficiary from whom recoupment is sought is entitled to contest all or part of the recoupment pursuant to the claims procedures of the plan that made the overpayment to the extent such procedures are consistent with section 1133 of this titlesection 402(c)(8)(B) of title 26(i) such plan shall notify the plan receiving the rollover of such dispute,(ii) the plan receiving the rollover shall retain such overpayment on behalf of the participant or beneficiary (and shall be entitled to treat such overpayment as plan assets) pending the outcome of such procedures, and(iii) the portion of such overpayment with respect to which recoupment is sought on behalf of the plan shall be permitted to be returned to such plan if it is determined to be an overpayment (and the plans making and receiving such transfer shall be treated as permitting such transfer).(H) In determining the amount of recoupment to seek, the responsible plan fiduciary may take into account the hardship that recoupment likely would impose on the participant or beneficiary.(5) Effect of culpabilitySubparagraphs (A) through (F) of paragraph (4) shall not apply to protect a participant or beneficiary who is culpable. For purposes of this paragraph, a participant or beneficiary is culpable if the individual bears responsibility for the overpayment (such as through misrepresentations o", "r omissions that led to the overpayment), or if the individual knew that the benefit payment or payments were materially in excess of the correct amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an individual is not culpable merely because the individual believed the benefit payment or payments were or might be in excess of the correct amount, if the individual raised that question with an authorized plan representative and was told the payment or payments were not in excess of the correct amount.(Pub.
