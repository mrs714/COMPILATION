No. 13103, Sept. 30, 1998The United States Government is the world\u2019s largest purchaser of computer-related services and equipment, purchasing more than $20 billion annually. At a time when a critical component in discussions with our international trading partners concerns their efforts to combat piracy of computer software and other intellectual property, it is incumbent on the United States to ensure that its own practices as a purchaser and user of computer software are beyond reproach. Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicy(a) Each agency shall adopt procedures to ensure that the agency does not acquire, reproduce, distribute, or transmit computer software in violation of applicable copyright laws.(b) Each agency shall establish procedures to ensure that the agency has present on its computers and uses only computer software not in violation of applicable copyright laws. These procedures may include:(1) preparing agency inventories of the software present on its computers;(2) determining what computer software the agency has the authorization to use; and(3) developing and maintaining adequate recordkeeping systems.(c) Contractors and recipients of Federal financial assistance, including recipients of grants and loan guarantee assistance, should have appropriate systems and controls in place to ensure that Federal funds are not used to acquire, operate, or maintain computer software in violation of applicable copyright laws.

Ord. No. 13960. Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal GovernmentEx. Ord. No. 13960, Dec. 3, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPurposeFebruary 11, 201942 U.S.C. 6601Agencies are already leading the way in the use of AI by applying it to accelerate regulatory reform; review Federal solicitations for regulatory compliance; combat fraud, waste, and abuse committed against taxpayers; identify information security threats and assess trends in related illicit activities; enhance the security and interoperability of Federal Government information systems; facilitate review of large datasets; streamline processes for grant applications; model weather patterns; facilitate predictive maintenance; and much more.Agencies are encouraged to continue to use AI, when appropriate, to benefit the American people. The ongoing adoption and acceptance of AI will depend significantly on public trust. Agencies must therefore design, develop, acquire, and use AI in a manner that fosters public trust and confidence while protecting privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and Am", "erican values, consistent with applicable law and the goals of Executive Order 13859.Certain agencies have already adopted guidelines and principles for the use of AI for national security or defense purposes, such as the Department of Defense\u2019s Ethical Principles for Artificial IntelligenceFebruary 24, 2020Principles of Artificial Intelligence Ethics for the Intelligence CommunityJuly 23, 2020July 23, 2020Section 3 of this order establishes additional principles (Principles) for the use of AI in the Federal Government for purposes other than national security and defense, to similarly ensure that such uses are consistent with our Nation\u2019s values and are beneficial to the public. This order further establishes a process for implementing these Principles through common policy guidance across agencies.Sec.Policy(b) It is the policy of the United States that responsible agencies, as defined in section 8 of this order, shall, when considering the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI in Government, be guided by the common set of Principles set forth in section 3 of this order, which are designed to foster public trust and confidence in the use of AI, protect our Nation\u2019s values, and ensure that the use of AI remains consistent with all applicable laws, including those related to privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.(c) It is the policy of the United States that the Principles for the use of AI in Government shall be governed by common policy guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as outlined in section 4 of this order, consistent with applicable law.Sec.Principles for Use of AI in Government(a) Lawful and respectful of our Nation\u2019s values. Agencies shall design, develop, acquire, and use AI in a manner that exhibits due respect for our Nation\u2019s values and is consistent with the Constitution and all other applicable laws and policies, including those addressing privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.(b) Purposeful and performance-driven. Agencies shall seek opportunities for d", "esigning, developing, acquiring, and using AI, where the benefits of doing so significantly outweigh the risks, and the risks can be assessed and managed.(c) Accurate, reliable, and effective. Agencies shall ensure that their application of AI is consistent with the use cases for which that AI was trained, and such use is accurate, reliable, and effective.(d) Safe, secure, and resilient. Agencies shall ensure the safety, security, and resiliency of their AI applications, including resilience when confronted with systematic vulnerabilities, adversarial manipulation, and other malicious exploitation.(e) Understandable. Agencies shall ensure that the operations and outcomes of their AI applications are sufficiently understandable by subject matter experts, users, and others, as appropriate.(f) Responsible and traceable. Agencies shall ensure that human roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, understood, and appropriately assigned for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI. Agencies shall ensure that AI is used in a manner consistent with these Principles and the purposes for which each use of AI is intended. The design, development, acquisition, and use of AI, as well as relevant inputs and outputs of particular AI applications, should be well documented and traceable, as appropriate and to the extent practicable.(g) Regularly monitored. Agencies shall ensure that their AI applications are regularly tested against these Principles. Mechanisms should be maintained to supersede, disengage, or deactivate existing applications of AI that demonstrate performance or outcomes that are inconsistent with their intended use or this order.(h) Transparent. Agencies shall be transparent in disclosing relevant information regarding their use of AI to appropriate stakeholders, including the Congress and the public, to the extent practicable and in accordance with applicable laws and policies, including with respect to the protection of privacy and of sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other prot", "ected information.(i) Accountable. Agencies shall be accountable for implementing and enforcing appropriate safeguards for the proper use and functioning of their applications of AI, and shall monitor, audit, and document compliance with those safeguards. Agencies shall provide appropriate training to all agency personnel responsible for the design, development, acquisition, and use of AI.Sec.Implementation of Principles(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order [Dec. 3, 2020(c) Agencies shall continue to use voluntary consensus standards developed with industry participation, where available, when such use would not be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impracticable. Such standards shall also be taken into consideration by OMB when revising or developing AI guidance.Sec.Agency Inventory of AI Use Cases(b) Within 180 days of the CIO Council\u2019s completion of the directive in section 5(a) of this order, and annually thereafter, each agency shall prepare an inventory of its non-classified and non-sensitive use cases of AI, within the scope defined by section 9 of this order, including current and planned uses, consistent with the agency\u2019s mission.(c) As part of their respective inventories of AI use cases, agencies shall identify, review, and assess existing AI deployed and operating in support of agency missions for any inconsistencies with this order.(i) Within 120 days of completing their respective inventories, agencies shall develop plans either to achieve consistency with this order for each AI application or to retire AI applications found to be developed or used in a manner that is not consistent with this order. These plans must be approved by the agency-designated responsible official(s), as described in section 8 of this order, within this same 120-day time period.(ii) In coordination with the Agency Data Governance Body and relevant officials from agencies not represented within that body, agencies shall strive to implement the approved plans within 180 days of plan approval, subject to exi", "sting resource levels.(d) Within 60 days of the completion of their respective inventories of use cases of AI, agencies shall share their inventories with other agencies, to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable law and policy, including those concerning protection of privacy and of sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other protected information. This sharing shall be coordinated through the CIO and Chief Data Officer Councils, as well as other interagency bodies, as appropriate, to improve interagency coordination and information sharing for common use cases.(e) Within 120 days of the completion of their inventories, agencies shall make their inventories available to the public, to the extent practicable and in accordance with applicable law and policy, including those concerning the protection of privacy and of sensitive law enforcement, national security, and other protected information.Sec.Interagency CoordinationSec.AI Implementation Expertise(b) Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in coordination with GSA and relevant agencies, shall create an inventory of Federal Government rotational programs and determine how these programs can be used to expand the number of employees with AI expertise at the agencies.(c) Within 180 days of the creation of the inventory of Government rotational programs described in section 7(b) of this order, OPM shall issue a report with recommendations for how the programs in the inventory can be best used to expand the number of employees with AI expertise at the agencies.

Findings and purposes(a) 1965 Findings and Purpose.\u2014(1) FindingsCongress finds and declares that the Appalachian regio", "n of the United States, while abundant in natural resources and rich in potential, lags behind the rest of the Nation in its economic growth and that its people have not shared properly in the Nation\u2019s prosperity. The region\u2019s uneven past development, with its historical reliance on a few basic industries and a marginal agriculture, has failed to provide the economic base that is a vital prerequisite for vigorous, self-sustaining growth. State and local governments and the people of the region understand their problems and have been working, and will continue to work, purposefully toward their solution. Congress recognizes the comprehensive report of the President\u2019s Appalachian Regional Commission documenting these findings and concludes that regionwide development is feasible, desirable, and urgently needed.(2) PurposeIt is the purpose of this subtitle to assist the region in meeting its special problems, to promote its economic development, and to establish a framework for joint federal and state efforts toward providing the basic facilities essential to its growth and attacking its common problems and meeting its common needs on a coordinated and concerted regional basis. The public investments made in the region under this subtitle shall be concentrated in areas where there is a significant potential for future growth and where the expected return on public dollars invested will be the greatest. States will be responsible for recommending local and state projects within their borders that will receive assistance under this subtitle. As the region obtains the needed physical and transportation facilities and develops its human resources, Congress expects that the region will generate a diversified industry and that the region will then be able to support itself through the workings of a strengthened free enterprise economy.(b) 1975 Findings and Purpose.\u2014(1) FindingsCongress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made toward achieving the purposes set out in subsection (a), especial", "ly with respect to the provision of essential public facilities, much remains to be accomplished, especially with respect to the provision of essential health, education, and other public services. Congress recognizes that changes and evolving national purposes in the decade since 1965 affect not only the Appalachian region but also its relationship to a nation that on December 31, 1975December 31, 1975(2) PurposeIt is also the purpose of this subtitle to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state and local efforts toward\u2014(A) anticipating the effects of alternative energy policies and practices;(B) planning for accompanying growth and change so as to maximize the social and economic benefits and minimize the social and environmental costs; and(C) implementing programs and projects carried out in the region by federal, state, and local governmental agencies so as to better meet the special problems generated in the region by the Nation\u2019s energy needs and policies, including problems of transportation, housing, community facilities, and human services.(c) 1998 Findings and Purpose(1) FindingsCongress further finds and declares that while substantial progress has been made in fulfilling many of the objectives of this subtitle, rapidly changing national and global economies over the decade ending November 13, 1998(2) PurposeIn addition to the purposes stated in subsections (a) and (b), it is the purpose of this subtitle\u2014(A) to assist the Appalachian region in\u2014(i) providing the infrastructure necessary for economic and human resource development;(ii) developing the region\u2019s industry;(iii) building entrepreneurial communities;(iv) generating a diversified regional economy; and(v) making the region\u2019s industrial and commercial resources more competitive in national and world markets;(B) to provide a framework for coordinating federal, state, and local initiatives to respond to the economic competitiveness challenges in the Appalachian region through\u2014(i) improving the skills of the region\u2019s workforce;(ii) adaptin", "g and applying new technologies for the region\u2019s businesses, including eco-industrial development technologies; and(iii) improving the access of the region\u2019s businesses to the technical and financial resources necessary to development of the businesses; and(C) to address the needs of severely and persistently distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus special attention on the areas of greatest need so as to provide a fairer opportunity for the people of the region to share the quality of life generally enjoyed by citizens across the United States.(Pub.

Yet reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) state that Federal contracts are awarded ", "to tens of thousands of companies with serious tax delinquencies. The total amount in unpaid taxes owed by these contracting companies is estimated to be more than $5 billion.Too often, Federal contracting officials do not have the most basic information they need to make informed judgments about whether a company trying to win a Federal contract is delinquent in paying its taxes. We need to give our contracting officials the tools they need to protect taxpayer dollars.Accordingly, I hereby direct the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (Commissioner) to direct a review of certifications of non-delinquency in taxes that companies bidding for Federal contracts are required to submit pursuant to a 2008 amendment to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. I further direct that the Commissioner report to me within 90 days on the overall accuracy of contractors\u2019 certifications.I also direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, working with the Secretary of the Treasury and other agency heads, to evaluate practices of contracting officers and debarring officials in response to contractors\u2019 certifications of serious tax delinquencies and to provide me, within 90 days, recommendations on process improvements to ensure these contractors are not awarded new contracts, including a plan to make contractor certifications available in a Government-wide database, as is already being done with other information on contractors.Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law.

L. 114\u2013328Executive Documents\nStreamlining Procurement Through Electronic CommerceMemorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies [and] the President\u2019s Management CouncilThe Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork of the current procurement system increases costs, produces unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity. Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-effectiveness. The electronic exch", "ange of acquisition information between the private sector and the Federal Government also will increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal purchases as quickly as possible.1. OBJECTIVES.The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:(a) exchange procurement information\u2014such as solicitations, offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other contractual documents\u2014electronically between the private sector and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;(b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement opportunities;(c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified access to the Federal Government\u2019s electronic commerce system;(d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data; and(e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and access Federal procurement data.2. IMPLEMENTATION.The President\u2019s Management Council, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary, shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch through the following actions:(a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-wide electronic commerce acqu", "isition system and identify executive departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing, operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;(b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations, quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-wide implementation;(c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting databases; and(d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the maximum extent possible.This implementation schedule should be accelerated where practicable.The head of each executive department or agency shall:(a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in each respective department or agency;(b) assist the President\u2019s Management Council in implementing the electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance with the schedules established herein; and(c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the President\u2019s Management Council and serve as a point of contact for the development and implementation of the Federal electronic commerce system within each respective department or agency.3. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nWilliam J.

No. 13005, May 21, 1996In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, it is necessary to secure broad-based competition for Federal contracts. This broad competition is best achieved where there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of producing quality goods and services at competitive prices. A great and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such contractors can be found in this Nation\u2019s economically distressed communities.Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those communities.

As the largest single purchaser of goods and services in the world, the United States Government bears a responsibility to ensure that taxpayer dollars do not contribute to trafficking in persons. By providing our Government workforce with additional tools and training to apply and enforce existing policy, and by providing additional clarity to Government contractors and subcontractors on the steps necessary to fully comply with that policy, this order will help to prot", "ect vulnerable individuals as contractors and subcontractors perform vital services and manufacture the goods procured by the United States.In addition, the improved safeguards provided by this order to strengthen compliance with anti-trafficking laws will promote economy and efficiency in Government procurement. These safeguards, which have been largely modeled on successful practices in the private sector, will increase stability, productivity, and certainty in Federal contracting by avoiding the disruption and disarray caused by the use of trafficked labor and resulting investigative and enforcement actions.SecAnti-Trafficking Provisions(1) strengthen the efficacy of the Government\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on trafficking in persons by Federal contractors and subcontractors in solicitations, contracts, and subcontracts for supplies or services (including construction and commercial items), by:(A) expressly prohibiting Federal contractors, contractor employees, subcontractors, and subcontractor employees from engaging in any of the following types of trafficking-related activities:(i) using misleading or fraudulent recruitment practices during the recruitment of employees, such as failing to disclose basic information or making material misrepresentations regarding the key terms and conditions of employment, including wages and fringe benefits, the location of work, living conditions and housing (if employer provided or arranged), any significant costs to be charged to the employee, and, if applicable, the hazardous nature of the work;(ii) charging employees recruitment fees;(iii) destroying, concealing, confiscating, or otherwise denying access by an employee to the employee\u2019s identity documents, such as passports or drivers\u2019 licenses; and(iv) for portions of contracts and subcontracts:(I) performed outside the United States, failing to pay return transportation costs upon the end of employment, for an employee who is not a national of the country in which the work is taking place and who was brought into that c", "ountry for the purpose of working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract;(II) not covered by subsection (a)(1)(A)(iv)(I) of this section, failing to pay return transportation costs upon the end of employment, for an employee who is not a national of the country in which the work is taking place and who was brought into that country for the purpose of working on a U.S. Government contract or subcontract, if the payment of such costs is required under existing temporary worker programs or pursuant to a written agreement with the employee; provided, however(III) that the requirements of subsections (a)(1)(A)(iv)(I) and (II) shall not apply to:(aa) an employee who is legally permitted to remain in the country of employment and who chooses to do so; or(bb) an employee who is a victim of trafficking and is seeking victim services or legal redress in the country of employment, or an employee who is a witness in a trafficking-related enforcement action;(v) other specific activities that the FAR Council identifies as directly supporting or promoting trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor in the performance of the contract or subcontract;(B) requiring contractors and their subcontractors, by contract clause, to agree to cooperate fully in providing reasonable access to allow contracting agencies and other responsible enforcement agencies to conduct audits, investigations, or other actions to ascertain compliance with the TVPA, this order, or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor; and(C) requiring contracting officers to notify, in accordance with agency procedures, the agency\u2019s Inspector General, the agency official responsible for initiating suspension or debarment actions, and law enforcement, if appropriate, if they become aware of any activities that would justify termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA, 22 U.S.C. 7104(g)(2) except as pro", "vided in subsection (a)(3) of this section, ensure that provisions in solicitations and clauses in contracts and subcontracts, where the estimated value of the supplies acquired or services required to be performed outside the United States exceeds $500,000, include the following requirements pertaining to the portion of the contract or subcontract performed outside the United States:(A) that each such contractor and subcontractor maintain a compliance plan during the performance of the contract or subcontract that is appropriate for the size and complexity of the contract or subcontract and the nature and scope of the activities performed, including the risk that the contract or subcontract will involve services or supplies susceptible to trafficking. The compliance plan shall be provided to the contracting officer upon request, and relevant contents of the plan shall be posted no later than the initiation of contract performance at the workplace and on the contractor or subcontractor\u2019s Web site (if one is maintained), and shall, at a minimum, include:(i) an awareness program to inform employees about:(I) the policy of ensuring that employees do not engage in trafficking in persons or related activities, including those specified in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor; and(II) the actions that will be taken against employees for violation of such policy;(ii) a process for employees to report, without fear of retaliation, any activity that would justify termination under section 106(g) of the TVPA, or is inconsistent with the requirements of this order, or any other applicable law or regulation establishing restrictions on trafficking in persons, the procurement of commercial sex acts, or the use of forced labor;(iii) a recruitment and wage plan that only permits the use of recruitment companies with trained employees, prohibits charging recruitment fees to the employee, and ensures that wages meet applicable host country legal requirements or e", "xplains any variance;(iv) a housing plan, if the contractor or subcontractor intends to provide or arrange housing, that ensures that the housing meets host country housing and safety standards or explains any variance;

Trump.\nGovernment ContractingMemorandum of President of the United States, Mar. 4, 2009Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesThe Federal Government has an overriding obligation to American taxpayers. It should perform its functions efficiently and effectively while ensuring that its actions result in the best value for the taxpayers.Since 2001, spending on Government contracts has more than doubled, reaching over $500 billion in 2008. During this same period, there has been a significant increase in the dollars awarded without full and open competition and an increase in the dollars obligated through cost-reimbursement contracts. Between fiscal years 2000 and 2008, for example, dollars obligated under cost-reimbursement contracts nearly doubled, from $71 billion in 2000 to $135 billion in 2008. Reversing these trends away from full and open competition and toward cost-reimbursement contracts could result in savings of billions of dollars each year for the American taxpayer.Excessive reliance by executive agencies on sole-source contracts (or contracts with a limited number of sources) and cost-reimbursement contracts creates a risk that taxpayer funds will be spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise no", "t well designed to serve the needs of the Federal Government or the interests of the American taxpayer. Reports by agency Inspectors General, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and other independent reviewing bodies have shown that noncompetitive and cost-reimbursement contracts have been misused, resulting in wasted taxpayer resources, poor contractor performance, and inadequate accountability for results.When awarding Government contracts, the Federal Government must strive for an open and competitive process. However, executive agencies must have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out their missions and achieve the policy goals of the Government. In certain exigent circumstances, agencies may need to consider whether a competitive process will not accomplish the agency\u2019s mission. In such cases, the agency must ensure that the risks associated with noncompetitive contracts are minimized.Moreover, it is essential that the Federal Government have the capacity to carry out robust and thorough management and oversight of its contracts in order to achieve programmatic goals, avoid significant overcharges, and curb wasteful spending. A GAO study last year of 95 major defense acquisitions projects found cost overruns of 26 percent, totaling $295 billion over the life of the projects. Improved contract oversight could reduce such sums significantly.Government outsourcing for services also raises special concerns. For decades, the Federal Government has relied on the private sector for necessary commercial services used by the Government, such as transportation, food, and maintenance. Office of Management and Budget Circular A\u201376, first issued in 1966, was based on the reasonable premise that while inherently governmental activities should be performed by Government employees, taxpayers may receive more value for their dollars if non-inherently governmental activities that can be provided commercially are subject to the forces of competition.However, the line between inherently governmental activities", " that should not be outsourced and commercial activities that may be subject to private sector competition has been blurred and inadequately defined. As a result, contractors may be performing inherently governmental functions. Agencies and departments must operate under clear rules prescribing when outsourcing is and is not appropriate.It is the policy of the Federal Government that executive agencies shall not engage in noncompetitive contracts except in those circumstances where their use can be fully justified and where appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect the taxpayer. In addition, there shall be a preference for fixed-price type contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts shall be used only when circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract. Moreover, the Federal Government shall ensure that taxpayer dollars are not spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the Federal Government\u2019s needs and to manage the risk associated with the goods and services being procured. The Federal Government must have sufficient capacity to manage and oversee the contracting process from start to finish, so as to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent wisely and are not subject to excessive risk. Finally, the Federal Government must ensure that those functions that are inherently governmental in nature are performed by executive agencies and are not outsourced.I hereby direct the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator of General Services, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the heads of such other agencies as the Director of OMB determines to be appropriate, and with the participation of appropriate management councils and program management officials, to develop and issue by July 1, 2009I further direct t", "he Director of OMB, in collaboration with the aforementioned officials and councils, and with input from the public, to develop and issue by September 30, 2009(1) govern the appropriate use and oversight of sole-source and other types of noncompetitive contracts and to maximize the use of full and open competition and other competitive procurement processes;(2) govern the appropriate use and oversight of all contract types, in full consideration of the agency\u2019s needs, and to minimize risk and maximize the value of Government contracts generally, consistent with the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to section 864 of Public Law 110\u2013417(3) assist agencies in assessing the capacity and ability of the Federal acquisition workforce to develop, manage, and oversee acquisitions appropriately; and(4) clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is not appropriate, consistent with section 321 of Public Law 110\u201341731 U.S.C. 501Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law.

If for purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree on a date other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the date agreed on by the parties shall be as close to the date of agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.(b) Valid DefenseIn determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) whether, and to what extent, a contract price was increased because the contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing data, it is a defense that the Federal Government did not rely on the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.(c) Invalid DefensesIt is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a contract under a contract provision required by subsection (a) that\u2014(1) the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the contractor or subcontractor\u2014(A) was the sole source of the property or services procured; or(B) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with respect to the property or services procured;(2) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the contracting officer;(3) the contract was based on an agreement between the contractor and the Federal Government about the total cost of the contract and th", "ere was no agreement about the cost of each item procured under the contract; or(4) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as required by section 3502(b) of this title(d) Offsets.\u2014(1) When allowedA contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract provision required by subsection (a) if\u2014(A) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to the best of the contractor\u2019s knowledge and belief, the contractor is entitled to the offset; and(B) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were available before the date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, consistent with subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, and that the data were not submitted as specified in section 3502(c) of this title(2) When not allowedA contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount otherwise authorized to be offset under paragraph (1) if\u2014(A) the certification under section 3502(b) of this title(B) the Federal Government proves that, had the cost or pricing data referred to in paragraph (1)(B) been submitted to the Federal Government before date of agreement on the price of the contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable, under subsection (a)(2), another date agreed on by the parties, the submission of the cost or pricing data would not have resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.(Pub.

Building on the progress of the past several years, we have truly begun to match the achievements of our medicine to the needs of our people.The task ahead is immense. As a nation, we will unceasingly pursue our research and learning, our training and building, our testing and treatment. But now our concern must also turn to the organization of our Federal health programs.As citizens we are entitled to the very best health services our resources can provide.As taxpayers, we demand the most efficient and economic health organizations that can be devised.I ask the Congress to approve a reorganization plan to bring new strength to the administration of Federal health programs.I propose a series of changes in the organization of the Public Health Service that will bring to all Americans a structure modern in design, more efficient in operation and better prepared to meet the great and growing needs of the future. Through such improvements we can achieve the full promise of the landmark health legislation enacted by the 89th Congress.I do not propose these changes lightly. They follow a period of careful deliberation. For many months the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Surgeon General have consulted leading experts in the Nation\u2014physicians, administrators", ", scientists, and public health specialists. They have confirmed my belief that modernization and reorganization of the Public Health Service are urgently required and long overdue.IIThe Public Health Service is an operating agency of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It is the principal arm of the Federal Government in the field of health. Its programs are among those most vital to our well-being.Since 1953 more than 50 new programs have been placed in the Public Health Service. Its budget over the past 12 years has increased tenfold\u2014from $250 million to $2.4 billion.Today the organization of the Public Health Service is clearly obsolete. The requirement that new and expanding programs be administered through an organizational structure established by law more than two decades ago stands as a major obstacle to the fulfillment of our Nation\u2019s health goals.As presently constituted, the Public Health Service is composed of four major components:National Institutes of Health.Bureau of State Services.Bureau of Medical Services.Office of the Surgeon General.Under present law, Public Health Service functions must be assigned only to these four components.This structure was designed to provide separate administrative arrangements for health research, programs of State and local aid, health services, and executive staff resources. At a time when these functions could be neatly compartmentalized, the structure was adequate. But today the situation is different.Under recent legislation many new programs provide for an integrated attack on specific disease problems or health hazards in the environment by combining health services, State and local aid, and research. Each new program of this type necessarily is assigned to one of the three operating components of the Public Health Service. Yet none of these components is intended to administer programs involving such a variety of approaches.Our health problems are difficult enough without having them complicated by outmoded organizational arrangements.But if w", "e merely take the step of integrating the four agencies within the Public Health Service we will not go far enough. More is required.IIIThe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare performs major health or health-related functions which are not carried out through the Public Health Service, although they are closely related to its functions. Among these are:Health insurance for the aged, administered through the Social Security Administration;Medical assistance for the needy, administered through the Welfare Administration;Regulation of the manufacture, labeling, and distribution of drugs, carried out through the Food and Drug Administration; andGrants-in-aid to States for vocational rehabilitation of the handicapped, administered by the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration.Expenditures for health and health-related programs of the Department administered outside the Public Health Service have increased from $44 million in 1953 to an estimated $5.4 billion in 1967.As the head of the Department, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is responsible for the Administration and coordination of all the Department\u2019s health functions. He has clear authority over the programs I have just mentioned.But today he lacks this essential authority over the Public Health Service. The functions of that agency are vested in the Surgeon General and not in the Secretary.This diffusion of responsibility is unsound and unwise.To secure the highest possible level of health services for the American people the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare must be given the authority to establish\u2014and modify as necessary\u2014the organizational structure for Public Health Service programs.He must also have the authority to coordinate health functions throughout the Department. The reorganization plan I propose will accomplish these purposes. It will provide the Secretary with the flexibility to create new and responsive organizational arrangements to keep pace with the changing and dynamic nature of our health programs.My views ", "in this respect follow a basic principle of good government set by the Hoover Commission in 1949 when it recommended that \u201cthe Department head should be given authority to determine the organization within his Department.\u201dIVIn summary, the reorganization plan would:Transfer to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare the functions now vested in the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service and in its various subordinate units (this transfer will not affect certain statutory advisory bodies such as the National Advisory Cancer and Heart Councils);Abolish the four principal statutory components of the Public Health Service, including the offices held by their heads (the Bureau of Medical Services, the Bureau of State Services, the National Institutes of Health exclusive of its several research institutes such as the National Cancer and Heart Institutes, and the Office of the Surgeon General); andAuthorize the Secretary to assign the functions transferred to him by the plan to officials and entities of the Public Health Service and to other agencies of the Department as he deems appropriate.Thus, the Secretary would be\u2014Enabled to assure that all health functions of the Department are carried out as effectively and economically as possible;Given authority commensurate with his responsibility; andMade responsible in fact for matters for which he is now, in any case, held accountable by the President, the Congress, and the people.VI have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.Should the reorganizations in the accompanying reorganization plan take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of the affected health programs. It is, however, not practicable at this time to itemize the reductions in expenditures which may result.I strongly recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan", " to become effective.\nLyndon B.

Ord. No. 14120. Advancing Women\u2019s Health Research and InnovationEx. Ord. No. 14120, Mar. 18, 2024By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyThe notion of including women in clinical trials used to be revolutionary\u2014which means many diagnostics and treatments were developed without women in mind and thus failed to account for women\u2019s health. Over 30 years ago, the Congress passed the landmark National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103\u201343Public Law 114\u2013255These policies led to significant increases in women\u2019s participation in clinical trials, and ongoing investments in biomedical research have supported breakthroughs in women\u2019s health. Through the discovery of genetic factors that increase the risk of breast cancer and innovations in mammography, we have transformed our approach to prevention, early detection, and treatment, and have improved outcomes for women facing a breast cancer diagnosis. We have improved access to life-saving treatments for women with severe heart failure by ensuring that the devices they need are the right size for a woman\u2019s body. We have also identified some of the most characteristic symptoms of heart attack in women, which are different from those in men\u2014discoverie", "s that have helped deliver faster treatment to women when every second counts. This is what we can achieve when we invest in women\u2019s health research.It is time, once again, to pioneer the next generation of discoveries in women\u2019s health. My Administration seeks to fundamentally change how we approach and fund women\u2019s health research in the United States. That is why I established the first-ever White House Initiative on Women\u2019s Health Research (Initiative)\u2014which is within the Office of the First Lady and includes a wide array of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and White House offices\u2014to accelerate research that will provide the tools we need to prevent, diagnose, and treat conditions that affect women uniquely, disproportionately, or differently.Together with the First Lady\u2019s tireless efforts, the Initiative is already galvanizing the Federal Government to advance women\u2019s health, including through investments in innovation and improved coordination within and across agencies. We are also mobilizing leaders across a wide range of sectors, including industry, philanthropy, and the medical and research communities, to improve women\u2019s health.It is the policy of my Administration to advance women\u2019s health research, close health disparities, and ensure that the gains we make in research laboratories are translated into real-world clinical benefits for women.

By contrast, increasing investments in women\u2019s health research can yield broad societal gains, including lower health care costs and a more productive and inclusive workforce.To address pervasive gaps in our knowledge of women\u2019s health, we must accelerate research on the unique health needs of women across their lifespans. Research gaps are especially acute for diseases and conditions that are more prevalent among women and for health conditions associated with women\u2019s midlife and later years, including perimenopause and menopause. Gaps are often even more significant for those who have been historically underrepresented in, or excluded from, research.We can\u2014and must\u2014increase our efforts to invest in research that maximizes our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat health conditions in women across the United States. Meaningful progress requires robust, dedicated research infrastructure\u2014including a strong, diverse research workforce\u2014and investment within and beyond the Federal Government. We all have a part to play in galvanizing women\u2019s health research, developing innovative and cutting-edge interventions that promote women\u2019s health, and ensuring that women across the United States have access to high-quality health care.Accordingly, I hereby direct the following actions:Sec.EstablishmentSec.Membership(b) In addition to the Chair, the members of the Initiative shall consist of the heads of the following executive departments and agencies (agencies) and offices, or their designees:(i) the Office of the Vice President;(ii) the Department of Defense;(iii) the Department of Agriculture;(iv) the Department of Health and Human Services;(v) the Department of Veterans Affairs;(vi) the Environmental Protection Agency;(vii) the Office of Management and Budget;(viii) the Domestic Policy Council;(ix) the Offic", "e of Science and Technology Policy;(x) the National Science Foundation;(xi) the National Institutes of Health;(xii) the Food and Drug Administration;(xiii) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;(xiv) the Indian Health Service;(xv) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;(xvi) the Health Resources and Services Administration;(xvii) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration;(xviii) the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality;(xix) the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health;(xx) the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women\u2019s Health; and(xxi) the heads of such other agencies and offices as the Chair may, from time to time, designate.(c) The Department of Health and Human Services shall provide funding and administrative support as may be necessary for the performance and functions of the Initiative, to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations.(d) At the direction of the Chair, the Initiative may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Initiative members or their designees, as appropriate, including to coordinate across agency offices dedicated to women\u2019s health.Sec.Mission and Functions(i) assessing the Federal research landscape to identify opportunities for additional investments that could catalyze significant progress in addressing women\u2019s health needs;(ii) setting Initiative-wide priorities to help guide strategic Federal research investments;(iii) improving coordination among agencies and offices pursuing women\u2019s health research, including by better integrating research efforts and facilitating interdisciplinary research;(iv) developing policy recommendations to better ensure that the health needs of women are considered, assessed, and reported for Federal research and data collection efforts, where feasible and in accordance with current research and data collection and analysis guidelines;(v) forming targeted recommendations to address health disparities and inequities affecting women, including those related to race, et", "hnicity, age, socioeconomic status, disability, and exposure to environmental factors and contaminants that can directly affect health;(vi) developing recommendations to support the translation of research advancements into practical benefits for patients and providers;(vii) identifying opportunities to develop public-private partnerships and to increase coordination of Federal efforts with the private and philanthropic sectors in order to drive innovation;(viii) engaging the scientific and research communities, including by helping promote the publication and dissemination of actionable research and data on women\u2019s health and by making Federal datasets available to support research;(ix) assessing opportunities to recruit, train, and support women pursuing health and biomedical research careers to help strengthen and diversify the research workforce; and(x) identifying ways to increase public awareness of the need for greater investment in and attention to women\u2019s health research, as well as women\u2019s health outcomes.(b) Consistent with the objectives of this memorandum and applicable law, the Initiative may gather relevant information from external stakeholders, including Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial government officials; researchers and academics; women\u2019s health organizations; philanthropic leaders; industry stakeholders; and other entities and persons that may assist the Initiative in accomplishing the objectives of this memorandum.Sec.Recommendations to the PresidentNov. 13, 2023(b) The heads of agencies and offices participating in the Initiative shall assist and provide information to the Chair, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Initiative.
