Ord. No. 13604. Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and Review of Infrastructure ProjectsEx. Ord. No. 13604, Mar. 22, 2012By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to significantly reduce the aggregate time required to make decisions in the permitting and review of infrastructure projects by the Federal Go", "vernment, while improving environmental and community outcomes, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyThe quality of our Nation\u2019s infrastructure depends in critical part on Federal permitting and review processes, including planning, approval, and consultation processes. These processes inform decision-makers and affected communities about the potential benefits and impacts of proposed infrastructure projects, and ensure that projects are designed, built, and maintained in a manner that is consistent with protecting our public health, welfare, safety, national security, and environment. Reviews and approvals of infrastructure projects can be delayed due to many factors beyond the control of the Federal Government, such as poor project design, incomplete applications, uncertain funding, or multiple reviews and approvals by State, local, tribal, or other jurisdictions. Given these factors, it is critical that executive departments and agencies (agencies) take all steps within their authority, consistent with available resources, to execute Federal permitting and review processes with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring the health, safety, and security of communities and the environment while supporting vital economic growth.To achieve that objective, our Federal permitting and review processes must provide a transparent, consistent, and predictable path for both project sponsors and affected communities. They must ensure that agencies set and adhere to timelines and schedules for completion of reviews, set clear permitting performance goals, and track progress against those goals. They must encourage early collaboration among agencies, project sponsors, and affected stakeholders in order to incorporate and address their interests and minimize delays. They must provide for transparency and accountability by utilizing cost-effective information technology to collect and disseminate information about individual projects and agency performance, so that the priorities and concerns of all our citizens a", "re considered. They must rely upon early and active consultation with State, local, and tribal governments to avoid conflicts or duplication of effort, resolve concerns, and allow for concurrent rather than sequential reviews. They must recognize the critical role project sponsors play in assuring the timely and cost-effective review of projects by providing complete information and analysis and by supporting, as appropriate, the costs associated with review. And, they must enable agencies to share priorities, work collaboratively and concurrently to advance reviews and permitting decisions, and facilitate the resolution of disputes at all levels of agency organization.Each of these elements must be incorporated into routine agency practice to provide demonstrable improvements in the performance of Federal infrastructure permitting and review processes, including lower costs, more timely decisions, and a healthier and cleaner environment. Also, these elements must be integrated into project planning processes so that projects are designed appropriately to avoid, to the extent practicable, adverse impacts on public health, security, historic properties and other cultural resources, and the environment, and to minimize or mitigate impacts that may occur. Permitting and review process improvements that have proven effective must be expanded and institutionalized.(b) In advancing this policy, this order expands upon efforts undertaken pursuant to Executive Order 13580 of July 12, 2011January 18, 2011August 31, 2011SecSteering Committee on Federal Infrastructure Permitting and Review Process Improvement(a) Infrastructure Projects Covered by this Order(b) Membership(i) the Department of Defense;(ii) the Department of the Interior;(iii) the Department of Agriculture;(iv) the Department of Commerce;(v) the Department of Transportation;(vi) the Department of Energy;(vii) the Department of Homeland Security;(viii) the Environmental Protection Agency;(ix) the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation;(x) the Department of t", "he Army; and(xi) such other agencies or offices as the CPO may invite to participate.(c) Projects of National or Regional SignificanceApril 30, 2012August 31, 2011(d) Responsibilities of the Steering Committee(i) develop a Federal Permitting and Review Performance Plan (Federal Plan), as described in section 3(a) of this order;(ii) implement the Federal Plan and coordinate resolution of disputes among Member Agencies relating to implementation of the Federal Plan; and(iii) coordinate and consult with other agencies, offices, and interagency working groups as necessary, including the President\u2019s Management Council and Performance Improvement Councils, and, with regard to use and expansion of the Dashboard, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and Chief Technology Officer to implement this order.(e) Duties of the CPO(i) in consultation with the Chair of CEQ and Member Agencies, issue guidance on the implementation of this order;(ii) in consultation with Member Agencies, develop and track performance metrics for evaluating implementation of the Federal Plan and Agency Plans; and(iii) by January 31, 2013(f) No Involvement in Particular Permits or ProjectsSecPlans for Measurable Performance ImprovementMay 31, 2012(i) institutionalizing best practices for: enhancing Federal, State, local, and tribal government coordination on permitting and review processes (such as conducting reviews concurrently rather than sequentially to the extent practicable); avoiding duplicative reviews; and engaging with stakeholders early in the permitting process;(ii) developing mechanisms to better communicate priorities and resolve disputes among agencies at the national and regional levels;(iii) institutionalizing use of the Dashboard, working with the CIO to enhance the Dashboard, and utilizing other cost-effective information technology systems to share environmental and project-related information with the public, project sponsors, and permit reviewers; and(iv) identifying timeframes and Member Agency responsibilities for the implementa", "tion of each proposed action.(b) Each Member Agency shall:(i) by June 30, 2012(1) performance metrics, including timelines or schedules for review;(2) technological improvements, such as institutionalized use of the Dashboard and other information technology systems;(3) other practices, such as pre-application procedures, early collaboration with other agencies, project sponsors, and affected stakeholders, and coordination with State, local, and tribal governments; and(4) steps the Member Agency will take to implement the Federal Plan.(ii) by July 31, 2012(iii) by December 31, 2012SecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order shall be implemented consistent with Executive Order 13175 of November 6, 2000November 5, 2009(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBarack Obama.\nEx.

No. 13707, Sept. 15, 2015A growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioral science insights\u2014research findings from fields such as behavioral economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them\u2014can be used to design government policies to better serve the American people.Where Federal policies have been designed to reflect behavioral science insights, they have substantially improved outcomes for the individuals, families, communities, and businesses those policies serve. For example, automatic enrollment and automatic escalation in retirement savings plans have made it easier to save for the future, and have helped Americans accumulate billions of dollars in additional retirement savings. Similarly, streamlining the application process for Federal financial aid has made college more financially accessible for millions of students.To more fully realize the benefits of behavioral insights and deliver better results at a lower cost for the American people, the Federal Government should design its policies and programs to reflect our best understanding of how people engage with, participate in, use, and respond to those policies and programs. By improving the effectiveness and", " efficiency of Government, behavioral science insights can support a range of national priorities, including helping workers to find better jobs; enabling Americans to lead longer, healthier lives; improving access to educational opportunities and support for success in school; and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, I hereby direct the following:SectionBehavioral Science Insights Policy Directive(a) Executive departments and agencies (agencies) are encouraged to:(i) identify policies, programs, and operations where applying behavioral science insights may yield substantial improvements in public welfare, program outcomes, and program cost effectiveness;(ii) develop strategies for applying behavioral science insights to programs and, where possible, rigorously test and evaluate the impact of these insights;(iii) recruit behavioral science experts to join the Federal Government as necessary to achieve the goals of this directive; and(iv) strengthen agency relationships with the research community to better use empirical findings from the behavioral sciences.(b) In implementing the policy directives in section (a), agencies shall:(i) identify opportunities to help qualifying individuals, families, communities, and businesses access public programs and benefits by, as appropriate, streamlining processes that may otherwise limit or delay participation\u2014for example, removing administrative hurdles, shortening wait times, and simplifying forms;(ii) improve how information is presented to consumers, borrowers, program beneficiaries, and other individuals, whether as directly conveyed by the agency, or in setting standards for the presentation of information, by considering how the content, format, timing, and medium by which information is conveyed affects comprehension and action by individuals, as appropriate;(iii) identify programs that offer choices and carefully consider how the presentat", "ion and structure of those choices, including the order, number, and arrangement of options, can most effectively promote public welfare, as appropriate, giving particular consideration to the selection and setting of default options; and(iv) review elements of their policies and programs that are designed to encourage or make it easier for Americans to take specific actions, such as saving for retirement or completing education programs. In doing so, agencies shall consider how the timing, frequency, presentation, and labeling of benefits, taxes, subsidies, and other incentives can more effectively and efficiently promote those actions, as appropriate. Particular attention should be paid to opportunities to use nonfinancial incentives.(c) For policies with a regulatory component, agencies are encouraged to combine this behavioral science insights policy directive with their ongoing review of existing significant regulations to identify and reduce regulatory burdens, as appropriate and consistent with Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011May 10, 2012SecImplementation of the Behavioral Science Insights Policy Directive(b) The NSTC shall release a yearly report summarizing agency implementation of section 1 of this order each year until 2019.

No. 13725, Apr. 15, 2016By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to protect American consumers and workers and encourage competition in the U.S. economy, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyCertain business practices such as unlawful collusion, illegal bid rigging, price fixing, and wage setting, as well as anticompetitive exclusionary conduct and mergers stifle competition and erode the foundation of America\u2019s economic vitality. The immediate results of such conduct\u2014higher prices and poorer service for customers, less innovation, fewer new businesses being launched, and reduced opportunities for workers\u2014can impact Americans in every walk of life.Competitive markets also help advance national priorities, such as the delivery of affordable health care, energy independence, and improved access to fast and affordable broadband. Competitive markets also promote economic growth, which creates opportunity for American workers and encourages entrepreneurs to start innovative companies that create jobs.The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have a proven record of detecting and stopping anticompetitive conduct and challenging mergers and acquisitions that threaten to consolidate markets and reduce competition.Promoting competitive markets and ensuring that consumers and workers have access to the information needed to make informed choices must be a shared priority across the Federal Government. Executive departments and agencies can contribute to these goals through, among other things, pro", "-competitive rulemaking and regulations, and by eliminating regulations that create barriers to or limit competition. Such Government-wide action is essential to ensuring that consumers, workers, startups, small businesses, and farms reap the full benefits of competitive markets.SecAgency Responsibilities(b) Agencies shall identify specific actions that they can take in their areas of responsibility to build upon efforts to detect abuses such as price fixing, anticompetitive behavior in labor and other input markets, exclusionary conduct, and blocking access to critical resources that are needed for competitive entry. Behaviors that appear to violate our antitrust laws should be referred to antitrust enforcers at DOJ and the FTC. Such a referral shall not preclude further action by the referring agency against that behavior under that agency\u2019s relevant statutory authority.(c) Agencies shall also identify specific actions that they can take in their areas of responsibility to address undue burdens on competition. As permitted by law, agencies shall consult with other interested parties to identify ways that the agency can promote competition through pro-competitive rulemaking and regulations, by providing consumers and workers with information they need to make informed choices, and by eliminating regulations that restrict competition without corresponding benefits to the American public.(d) Not later than 30 days from the date of this order, agencies shall submit to the Director of the National Economic Council an initial list of (1) actions each agency can potentially take to promote more competitive markets; (2) any specific practices, such as blocking access to critical resources, that potentially restrict meaningful consumer or worker choice or unduly stifle new market entrants, along with any actions the agency can potentially take to address those practices; and (3) any relevant authorities and tools potentially available to enhance competition or make information more widely available for consumers and wor", "kers.(e) Not later than 60 days from the date of this order, agencies shall report to the President, through the Director of the National Economic Council, recommendations on agency-specific actions that eliminate barriers to competition, promote greater competition, and improve consumer access to information needed to make informed purchasing decisions. Such recommendations shall include a list of priority actions, including rulemakings, as well as timelines for completing those actions.(f) Subsequently, agencies shall report semi-annually to the President, through the Director of the National Economic Council, on additional actions that they plan to undertake to promote greater competition.(g) Sections 2(d), 2(e), and 2(f) of this order do not require reporting of information related to law enforcement policy and activities.SecGeneral Provisions(b) Independent agencies are strongly encouraged to comply with the requirements of this order.(c) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to a department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBarack Obama.\nEx.

No. 13966, Dec. 14, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 305 of title 5section 301 of title 3SectionPolicy and PrinciplesFebruary 24, 2017My Administration is committed to continuing this important work by partnering with State, local, territorial, and tribal leaders throughout the country to eliminate harmful occupational regulations, which are frequently designed to protect politically connected interest groups. To this end, in October 2019, my Administration announced the establishment of the Governors\u2019 Initiative on Regulatory Innovation, which works with State, local, and tribal leaders to advance occupational licensing reforms, better align State and Federal regulations, and eliminate unnecessary regulations that drive up consumer costs.Occupational regulations can protect practitioners from competition rather than protect the public from malpractice. Unfortunately, the number of occupational regulations has substantially increased over the last few decades. Since the 1950s, the percentage of jobs requiring a government-mandated occupational license has increased from less than 5 percent to between 25 and 30 percent. By requiring workers to acquire new licenses w", "hen they move to a new jurisdiction, occupational regulations reduce worker mobility, disproportionately harm low-income Americans, and are particularly burdensome to military spouses who must relocate to support the service members committed to keeping our country safe. Additionally, blanket prohibitions that prevent individuals with criminal records from obtaining occupational licenses may exacerbate disparities in employment opportunity and increase the likelihood of recidivism, particularly as regulatory barriers to enter lower- and middle-income occupations are associated with higher recidivism rates. Licensing requirements unnecessary to protect consumers from significant and demonstrable harm also frequently impose expensive educational requirements on potential job seekers, even for occupations with limited future earnings potential. According to recent research, licensing requirements have cost our country an estimated 2.85 million jobs and over $200 billion annually in increased consumer costs.Therefore, it is the policy of the United States Government to support occupational regulation reform throughout the Nation, building on occupational licensing reforms enacted most recently in Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota, guided by six principles:Principle 1Principle 2Principle 3Principle 4Principle 5(a) the individual holds an occupational license for that discipline from another jurisdiction in the United States and is in good standing;(b) the individual verifies having met, as applicable, the minimum examination, education, work, or clinical-supervision requirements imposed by the State, territory, or tribe;(c) the individual:(i) has not had the license previously revoked or suspended;(ii) has not been disciplined related to the license by any other regulating entity; and(iii) is not subject to any pending complaint, allegation, or investigation related to the license; and(d) the individual pays all applicable fees required to obtain the new license.Principle 6Sec.Review of and Report on ", "Authorities, Regulations, Guidance, and PoliciesDec. 14, 2020(a) review the agency\u2019s authorities, regulations, guidance, and polices to identify changes necessary to ensure alignment with the principles set forth in section 1 of this order;

Ord. No. 13985, Jan. 20, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:SectionPolicyIt is therefore the policy of my Administration that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government. Because advancing equity requires a systematic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must recognize and work to redress inequities in their policies and programs that serve as barriers to equal opportunity.By advancing equity across the Federal Government, we can create opportunities for the improvement of communities that have been historically underserved, which benefits everyone. For example, an analysis shows that closing racial gaps in wages, housing credit, lending opportunities, and access to higher education would amount to an additional $5 trillion in gross domestic product in the American economy over the next 5 years. The Federal Government\u2019s goal in advancing equity is to provide everyone with the opportunity to reach their full potential. Consistent with these aims, each agency must assess whether, and to what extent, its programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for people of color and other underserved groups.

No. 14091, Feb. 16, 2023By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyJanuary 20, 2021Over the past 2 years, through landmark legislation\u2014including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117\u20132Public Law 117\u201358Public Law 117\u2013167Public Law 117\u2013169Public Law 117\u2013159June 25, 202142 U.S.C. 2000eMy Administration\u2019s commitment to equity has produced better decision-making and more equitable outcomes. We have delivered the most equitable economic recovery in memory, and, driven by the expanded Child Tax Credit, we cut child poverty to its lowest rate on record in 2021, including record low Black, Latino, Native American, and rural child poverty. Under my Administration, the economy has created nearly 11 million jobs, and we have brought down unemployment nationwide\u2014in particular for Black and Latino workers, for whom unemployment rates are near 50-year lows. My Administration has provided emergency rental assistance to help millions of families stay in their homes, and we have prohibited Federal contractors from paying people with disabilities subminimum wages. We are rebuilding roads and bridges, replacing the Nation\u2019s lead pipes to provide clea", "n drinking water for all, delivering access to affordable high-speed internet to Americans in both rural and urban communities, investing in public transit, and reconnecting communities previously cut off from economic opportunity by highways, rail lines, or disinvestment. My Administration has provided funding to improve accessibility for passengers with disabilities on rail systems and in airports, expanded health coverage for millions of Americans, and expanded home- and community-based services so more people with disabilities and older adults can live independently. We have secured billions of dollars in direct new investments for Tribal Nations and Native American communities and have directed an increase in the share of Federal Government contract spending awarded to small disadvantaged businesses. My Administration has taken action to strengthen public safety, advance criminal justice reform, correct our country\u2019s failed approach to marijuana, protect civil rights, and stand up against rising extremism and hate-fueled violence that threaten the fabric of our democracy. We have taken historic steps to advance full equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) Americans, including by ending the ban on transgender service members in our military; prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics across Federal programs; and signing into law the Respect for Marriage Act (Public Law 117\u2013228section 1738C of Title 28section 7 of Title 1section 1738C of Title 28These transformative achievements have advanced the work of building a more equitable Nation. Yet, members of underserved communities\u2014many of whom have endured generations of discrimination and disinvestment\u2014still confront significant barriers to realizing the full promise of our great Nation, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to remove these barriers. It is imperative to reject the narrow, cramped view of American opportunity as a zero-sum game. When any person ", "or community is denied freedom, dignity, and prosperity, our entire Nation is held back. But when we lift each other up, we are all lifted up. Therefore, my Administration must take additional action across the Federal Government\u2014in collaboration with civil society, the private sector, and State and local government\u2014to continue the work begun with Executive Order 13985 to combat discrimination and advance equal opportunity, including by redressing unfair disparities and removing barriers to Government programs and services. Achieving racial equity and support for underserved communities is not a one-time project. It must be a multi-generational commitment, and it must remain the responsibility of agencies across the Federal Government. It therefore continues to be the policy of my Administration to advance an ambitious, whole-of-government approach to racial equity and support for underserved communities and to continuously embed equity into all aspects of Federal decision-making.This order builds upon my previous equity-related Executive Orders by extending and strengthening equity-advancing requirements for agencies, and it positions agencies to deliver better outcomes for the American people.

Clinton.\nPreemptionMemorandum of President of the United States, May 20, 2009Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesFrom our Nation\u2019s founding, the American constitutional order has been a Federal system, ensuring a strong role for both the national Government and the States. The Federal Government\u2019s role in promoting the general welfare and guarding individual liberties is critical, but State law and national law often operate concurrently to provide independent safeguards for the public. Throughout our history, State and local governments have frequently protected health, safety, and the environment more aggressively than has the national Government.An understanding of the important role of State governments in our Federal system is reflected in longstanding practices by executive departments and agencies, which have shown respect for the traditional prerogatives of the States. In recent years, however, notwithstanding Executive Order 13132 of August 4, 1999The purpose of this memorandum is to state the general policy of my Administration that preemption of State law by execu", "tive departments and agencies should be undertaken only with full consideration of the legitimate prerogatives of the States and with a sufficient legal basis for preemption. Executive departments and agencies should be mindful that in our Federal system, the citizens of the several States have distinctive circumstances and values, and that in many instances it is appropriate for them to apply to themselves rules and principles that reflect these circumstances and values. As Justice Brandeis explained more than 70 years ago, \u201c[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\u201dTo ensure that executive departments and agencies include statements of preemption in regulations only when such statements have a sufficient legal basis:1. Heads of departments and agencies should not include in regulatory preambles statements that the department or agency intends to preempt State law through the regulation except where preemption provisions are also included in the codified regulation.2. Heads of departments and agencies should not include preemption provisions in codified regulations except where such provisions would be justified under legal principles governing preemption, including the principles outlined in Executive Order 13132.3. Heads of departments and agencies should review regulations issued within the past 10 years that contain statements in regulatory preambles or codified provisions intended by the department or agency to preempt State law, in order to decide whether such statements or provisions are justified under applicable legal principles governing preemption. Where the head of a department or agency determines that a regulatory statement of preemption or codified regulatory provision cannot be so justified, the head of that department or agency should initiate appropriate action, which may include amendment of the relevant regulat", "ion.Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their statutory authorities. Heads of departments and agencies should consult as necessary with the Attorney General and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to determine how the requirements of this memorandum apply to particular situations.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama.\nRegulatory ComplianceMemorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 18, 2011Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesMy Administration is committed to enhancing effectiveness and efficiency in Government. Pursuant to the Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government, issued on January 21, 2009To that end, much progress has been made toward strengthening our democracy and improving how Government operates. In the regulatory area, several agencies, such as the Department of Labor and the Environmental Protection Agency, have begun to post online (at ogesdw.dol.gov and www.epa-echo.gov), and to make readily accessible to the public, information concerning their regulatory compliance and enforcement activities, such as information with respect to administrative inspections, examinations, reviews, warnings, citations, and revocations (but excluding law enforcement or otherwise sensitive information about ongoing enforcement actions).Greater disclosure of regulatory compliance information fosters fair and consistent enforcement of important regulatory obligations. Such disclosure is a critical step in encouraging the public to hold the Government and regulated en", "tities accountable. Sound regulatory enforcement promotes the welfare of Americans in many ways, by increasing public safety, improving working conditions, and protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink. Consistent regulatory enforcement also levels the playing field among regulated entities, ensuring that those that fail to comply with the law do not have an unfair advantage over their law-abiding competitors. Greater agency disclosure of compliance and enforcement data will provide Americans with information they need to make informed decisions. Such disclosure can lead the Government to hold itself more accountable, encouraging agencies to identify and address enforcement gaps.Accordingly, I direct the following:FirstSecondThirdThis memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

More than half of all Americans working in the private sector either are employed by a small business or own one. During a recent 15-year period, small businesses created more than 60 percent of all new jobs in the Nation.Although small businesses and new companies provide the foundations for economic growth and job creation, they have faced severe challenges as a result of the recession.", " One consequence has been the loss of significant numbers of jobs.The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601\u20136125 U.S.C. 601To promote its central goals, the RFA imposes a series of requirements designed to ensure that agencies produce regulatory flexibility analyses that give careful consideration to the effects of their regulations on small businesses and explore significant alternatives in order to minimize any significant economic impact on small businesses. Among other things, the RFA requires that when an agency proposing a rule with such impact is required to provide notice of the proposed rule, it must also produce an initial regulatory flexibility analysis that includes discussion of significant alternatives. Significant alternatives include the use of performance rather than design standards; simplification of compliance and reporting requirements for small businesses; establishment of different timetables that take into account the resources of small businesses; and exemption from coverage for small businesses.Consistent with the goal of open government, the RFA also encourages public participation in and transparency about the rulemaking process. Among other things, the statute requires agencies proposing rules with a significant economic impact on small businesses to provide an opportunity for public comment on any required initial regulatory flexibility analysis, and generally requires agencies promulgating final rules with such significant economic impact to respond, in a final regulatory flexibility analysis, to comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.My Administration is firmly committed to eliminating excessive and unjustified burdens on small businesses, and to ensuring that regulations are designed with careful consideration of their effects, including their cumulative effects, on small businesses. Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993In the current economic environment, it is especially important for agencies to design regulations in", " a cost-effective manner consistent with the goals of promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.Accordingly, I hereby direct executive departments and agencies and request independent agencies, when initiating rulemaking that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, to give serious consideration to whether and how it is appropriate, consistent with law and regulatory objectives, to reduce regulatory burdens on small businesses, through increased flexibility. As the RFA recognizes, such flexibility may take many forms, including:\u2022 extended compliance dates that take into account the resources available to small entities;\u2022 performance standards rather than design standards;\u2022 simplification of reporting and compliance requirements (as, for example, through streamlined forms and electronic filing options);\u2022 different requirements for large and small firms; and\u2022 partial or total exemptions.I further direct that whenever an executive agency chooses, for reasons other than legal limitations, not to provide such flexibility in a proposed or final rule that is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, it should explicitly justify its decision not to do so in the explanation that accompanies that proposed or final rule.Adherence to these requirements is designed to ensure that regulatory actions do not place unjustified economic burdens on small business owners and other small entities. If regulations are preceded by careful analysis, and subjected to public comment, they are less likely to be based on intuition and guesswork and more likely to be justified in light of a clear understanding of the likely consequences of alternative courses of action. With that understanding, agencies will be in a better position to protect the public while avoiding excessive costs and paperwork.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in", " equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama.\nModernizing Federal Infrastructure Review and Permitting Regulations, Policies, and ProceduresMemorandum of President of the United States, May 17, 2013Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesReliable, safe, and resilient infrastructure is the backbone of an economy built to last. Investing in our Nation\u2019s infrastructure serves as an engine for job creation and economic growth, while bringing immediate and long-term economic benefits to communities across the country. The quality of our infrastructure is critical to maintaining our Nation\u2019s competitive edge in a global economy and to securing our path to energy independence. In taking steps to improve our infrastructure, we must remember that the protection and continued enjoyment of our Nation\u2019s environmental, historical, and cultural resources remain an equally important driver of economic opportunity, resiliency, and quality of life.Through the implementation of Executive Order 13604 of March 22, 2012These best-management practices include: integrating project reviews among agencies with permitting responsibilities; ensuring early coordination with other Federal agencies, as well as with State, local, and tribal governments; strategically engaging with, and conducting outreach to, stakeholders; employing project-planning processes and individual project designs that consider local and regional ecological planning goals; utilizing landscape- and watershed-level mitigation practices; promoting the sharing of scientific and environmental data in open-d", "ata formats to minimize redundancy, facilitate informed project planning, and identify data gaps early in the review and permitting process; promoting performance-based permitting and regulatory approaches; expanding the use of general permits where appropriate; improving transparency and accountability through the electronic tracking of review and permitting schedules; and applying best environmental and cultural practices as set forth in existing statutes and policies.Based on the process and policy improvements that are already being implemented across the Federal Government, we can continue to modernize the Federal Government\u2019s review and permitting of infrastructure projects and reduce aggregate timelines for major infrastructure projects by half, while also improving outcomes for communities and the environment by institutionalizing these best-management practices, and by making additional improvements to enhance efficiencies in the application of regulations and processes involving multiple agencies\u2014including expanding the use of web-based techniques for sharing project-related information, facilitating targeted and relevant environmental reviews, and providing meaningful opportunities for public input through stakeholder engagement.By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to advance the goal of cutting aggregate timelines for major infrastructure projects in half, while also improving outcomes for communities and the environment, I hereby direct the following:SectionModernization of Review and Permitting Regulations, Policies, and ProceduresThis modernization shall build upon and incorporate reforms identified by agencies pursuant to Executive Order 13604 and Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011(b) Through an interagency process, coordinated by the CPO and working closely with CEQ and OIRA, the Steering Committee shall conduct the following modernization efforts:(i) Within 60 days of the date of this memorandum, the Steering Comm", "ittee shall identify and prioritize opportunities to modernize key regulations, policies, and procedures\u2014both agency-specific and those involving multiple agencies\u2014to reduce the aggregate project review and permitting time, while improving environmental and community outcomes.(ii) Within 120 days of the date of this memorandum, the Steering Committee shall prepare a plan for a comprehensive modernization of Federal review and permitting for infrastructure projects based on the analysis required by subsection (b)(i) of this section that outlines specific steps for re-engineering both the intra- and inter-agency review and approval processes based on experience implementing Executive Order 13604. The plan shall identify proposed actions and associated timelines to:(1) institutionalize or expand best practices or process improvements that agencies are already implementing to improve the efficiency of reviews, while improving outcomes for communities and the environment;(2) revise key review and permitting regulations, policies, and procedures (both agency-specific and Government-wide);(3) identify high-performance attributes of infrastructure projects that demonstrate how the projects seek to advance existing statutory and policy objectives and how they lead to improved outcomes for communities and the environment, thereby facilitating a faster and more efficient review and permitting process;(4) create process efficiencies, including additional use of concurrent and integrated reviews;(5) identify opportunities to use existing share-in-cost authorities and other non-appropriated funding sources to support early coordination and project review;(6) effectively engage the public and interested stakeholders;(7) expand coordination with State, local, and tribal governments;(8) strategically expand the use of information technology (IT) tools and identify priority areas for IT investment to replace paperwork processes, enhance effective project siting decisions, enhance interagency collaboration, and improve the monitori", "ng of project impacts and mitigation commitments; and(9) identify improvements to mitigation policies to provide project developers with added predictability, facilitate landscape-scale mitigation based on conservation plans and regional environmental assessments, facilitate interagency mitigation plans where appropriate, ensure accountability and the long-term effectiveness of mitigation activities, and utilize innovative mechanisms where appropriate.The modernization plan prepared pursuant to this section shall take into account funding and resource constraints and shall prioritize implementation accordingly.(c) Infrastructure sectors covered by the modernization effort include: surface transportation, such as roadways, bridges, railroads, and transit; aviation; ports and related infrastructure, including navigational channels; water resources projects; renewable energy generation; conventional energy production in high-demand areas; electricity transmission; broadband; pipelines; storm water infrastructure; and other sectors as determined by the Steering Committee.(d) The following agencies or offices and their relevant sub-divisions shall engage in the modernization effort:(i) the Department of Defense;(ii) the Department of the Interior;(iii) the Department of Agriculture;(iv) the Department of Commerce;(v) the Department of Transportation;(vi) the Department of Energy;(vii) the Department of Homeland Security;(viii) the Environmental Protection Agency;(ix) the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation;(x) the Department of the Army;(xi) the Council on Environmental Quality; and(xii) such other agencies or offices as the CPO may invite to participate.SecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals, or the regulatory review process.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and sub", "ject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994November 6, 2000November 5, 2009(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(e) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama.\nExpanding Federal Support for Predevelopment Activities for Nonfederal Domestic Infrastructure AssetsMemorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 16, 2015Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesThe United States is significantly underinvesting in both the maintenance of existing public infrastructure and the development of new infrastructure projects. While there is no replacement for adequate public funding, innovative financing options and increased collaboration between the private and public sectors can help to increase overall investment in infrastructure.However, a major challenge for innovative infrastructure projects, whether using emerging technologies or alternative financing, is the lack of funding for the phases of infrastructure project development that precede actual construction. Infrastructure projects require upfront costs, commonly known as \u201cpredevelopment\u201d costs, for activities such as project and system planning, economic impact analyses, preliminary engineering assessments, and environmental review. Although only accounting for a small percentage of total costs, predevelopment activities have considerable influence on which projects will move forward, where and how they will be built, who will fund them, and who will benefit from them. Yet, in light of factors like fiscal constraints, the extent of overall needs, and risk aversion, State, local, and tribal governments ", "tend to focus scarce resources on constructing and developing conventional projects and addressing their most critical infrastructure needs, thereby underinvesting in predevelopment.Greater attention to the predevelopment phase could yield a range of benefits\u2014for example, providing the opportunity to develop longer-term, more innovative, and more complex infrastructure projects and facilitating assessment of a range of financing approaches, including public-private partnerships. Additional investment in predevelopment costs also may enable State, local, and tribal governments to utilize innovations in infrastructure design and emerging technologies, reduce long-term costs to infrastructure project users, and provide other benefits, such as improved environmental performance and enhanced resilience to climate change.The Federal Government can meaningfully expand opportunities for public-private collaboration, encourage more transformational projects, and improve project outcomes by encouraging Federal investment in robust predevelopment activities and providing other forms of support, such as technical assistance, to communities during the predevelopment phase.Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:SectionPolicySecDefinitions(a) \u201cPredevelopment activities\u201d means activities that provide decisionmakers with the opportunity to identify and assess potential infrastructure projects and modifications to existing infrastructure projects, and to advance those projects from the conceptual phase to actual construction. Predevelopment activities include:(i) project planning, feasibility studies, economic assessments and cost-benefit analyses, and public benefit studies and value-for-money analyses;(ii) design and engineering;(iii) financial planning (including the identification of funding and financing options);(iv) permitting, environmental review, and regulatory processes;(v) assessment of the impacts of potentia", "l projects on the area, including the effect on communities, the environment, the workforce, and wages and benefits, as well as assessment of infrastructure vulnerability and resilience to climate change and other risks; and(vi) public outreach and community engagement.(b) \u201cPredevelopment funding\u201d means funding for predevelopment activities and associated costs, such as flexible staff, external advisors, convening potential investment partners, and associated legal costs directly related to predevelopment activities.SecFederal Action to Support Predevelopment Activities(a) the Department of Commerce, through the Economic Development Administration\u2019s Public Works grants and Economic Adjustment Assistance grants, and consistent with the programs\u2019 mission and goals, shall take steps to increase assistance for the predevelopment phase of infrastructure projects;(b) the Department of Transportation shall develop guidance to clarify where predevelopment activities are eligible for funding through its programs. To further encourage early collaboration in the project development process, the Department of Transportation shall also clarify options for providing early feedback into environmental review processes;(c) the Department of Homeland Security shall clarify for grantees where predevelopment funding is available through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program;(d) the Department of Housing and Urban Development shall clarify for grantees how the Community Development Block Grant program and other Federal funding sources can be used for predevelopment activities;(e) the Department of Agriculture shall develop guidance to clarify where predevelopment activities are eligible for funding through its programs, including grants for water and waste projects pursuant to 7 CFR 1780.1 et seq., the Special Evaluation Assistance for Rural Communities and Households Program, the Community Facilities Grant program, and the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program. To encourage innovative predevelopment work, the Department of", " Agriculture shall also train Water and Environmental Programs field staff on predevelopment best practices and prioritize predevelopment in the Department of Agriculture\u2019s project development process; and(f) the other members of the Working Group established in section 3 of my memorandum of July 17, 2014SecImplementation, Public Education, and Best PracticesSecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(c) The Secretary of Transportation is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u201cSEC. 201.

Special interests exert t", "his disproportionate influence, in part, by relying on lobbyists who have special access that is not available to all citizens. Although lobbyists can sometimes play a constructive role by communicating information to the government, their service in privileged positions within the executive branch can perpetuate the culture of special-interest access that I am committed to changing.On the day after my inauguration, I signed Executive Order 13490, which places strict limits on the ability of lobbyists to serve in Government positions related to their prior lobbying activities. Last September, we took another step to close the revolving door through which lobbyists enter and exit Government positions when we announced that my Administration aspires to keep Federal agencies\u2019 advisory boards free of federally registered lobbyists. Many departments and agencies are making this aspiration a reality by no longer placing federally registered lobbyists on advisory boards\u2014a practice that I am now establishing as the official policy of my Administration.Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive departments and agencies not to make any new appointments or reappointments of federally registered lobbyists to advisory committees and other boards and commissions. Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue proposed guidance designed to implement this policy to the full extent permitted by law. The final guidance shall be issued following public comment on the proposed guidance.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f1003.

Effective DateThe provisions of t", "his Reorganization Plan shall become effective at such time or times, on or before January 1, 1979Section 906 of Title 5[Pursuant to Ex. Ord. No. 12107, Dec. 28, 1978Jan. 1, 1979Message of the PresidentTo the Congress of the United States:On March 2nd I sent to Congress a Civil Service Reform proposal to enable the Federal government to improve its service to the American people.Today I am submitting another part of my comprehensive proposal to reform the Federal personnel management system through Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978. The plan will reorganize the Civil Service Commission and thereby create new institutions to increase the effectiveness of management and strengthen the protection of employee rights.The Civil Service Commission has acquired inherently conflicting responsibilities: to help manage the Federal Government and to protect the rights of Federal employees. It has done neither job well. The Plan would separate the two functions.office of personnel managementThe positive personnel management tasks of the government\u2014such as training, productivity programs, examinations, and pay and benefits administration\u2014would be the responsibility of an Office of Personnel Management. Its Director, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would be responsible for administering Federal personnel matters except for Presidential appointments. The Director would be the government\u2019s principal representative in Federal labor relations matters.merit systems protection boardThe adjudication and prosecution responsibilities of the Civil Service Commission will be performed by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Board will be headed by a bipartisan panel of three members appointed to six-year, staggered terms. This Board would be the first independent and institutionally impartial Federal agency solely for the protection of Federal employees.The Plan will create, within the Board, a Special Counsel to investigate and prosecute political abuses and merit system violations. Under the civil service refo", "rm legislation now being considered by the Congress, the Counsel would have power to investigate and prevent reprisals against employees who report illegal acts\u2014the so-called \u201cwhistleblowers.\u201d The Council would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.federal labor relations authorityAn Executive Order now vests existing labor-management relations in a part-time Federal Labor-Relations Council, comprised of three top government managers; other important functions are assigned to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations. This arrangement is defective because the Council members are part-time, they come exclusively from the ranks of management and their jurisdiction is fragmented.The Plan I submit today would consolidate the central policymaking functions in labor-management relations now divided between the Council and the Assistant Secretary into one Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Authority would be composed of three full-time members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Its General Counsel, also appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would present unfair labor practice complaints. The Plan also provides for the continuance of the Federal Service Impasses Panel within the Authority to resolve negotiating impasses between Federal employee unions and agencies.The cost of replacing the Civil Service Commission can be paid by our present resources. The reorganization itself would neither increase nor decrease the costs of personnel management throughout the government. But taken together with the substantive reforms I have proposed, this Plan will greatly improve the government\u2019s ability to manage programs, speed the delivery of Federal services to the public, and aid in executing other reorganizations I will propose to the Congress, by improving Federal personnel management.Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in 5 U.S.C. 901(a)5 U.S.C. 5109(b)5 U.", "S.C. 1103(d)I am confident that this Plan and the companion civil service reform legislation will both lead to more effective protection of Federal employees\u2019 legitimate rights and a more rewarding workplace. At the same time the American people will benefit from a better managed, more productive and more efficient Federal Government.\nJimmy Carter.The White House,May 23, 1978\nExecutive Order No. 10729Ex.

Federal employees and members of the uniformed services can also be solicited to make pledges of volunteer time. These arrangements shall take the form of an annual Combined Federal Campaign in which eligible voluntary health and welfare organizations are authorized to take part.(b) The Director shall consider permitting annuitants to make contributions to the Combined Federal Campaign through allotments or assignments of amounts from their Federal annuities. The Director may prescribe rules and regulations to govern the solicitation of such contributions and make arrangements to inform annuitants of their ability to make contributions in", " this manner.Sec(b) In establishing those criteria, the Director shall be guided by the following principles and policies:(1) The objectives of the Combined Federal Campaign are to lessen the burdens of government in meeting needs of human health and welfare; to provide a convenient channel through which Federal public servants may contribute to these efforts; to minimize or eliminate disruption of the Federal workplace and costs to Federal taxpayers that such fund-raising may entail; and to avoid the reality and appearance of the use of Federal resources in aid of fund-raising for political activity or advocacy of public policy, lobbying, or philanthropy of any kind that does not directly serve needs of human health and welfare.(2) To meet these objectives, eligibility for participation in the Combined Federal Campaign shall be limited to voluntary, charitable, health and welfare organizations that provide or support direct health and welfare services to individuals or their families. Such direct health and welfare services must be available to Federal employees in the local campaign solicitation area, unless they are rendered to needy persons overseas. Such services must directly benefit human beings, whether children, youth, adults, the aged, the ill and infirm, or the mentally or physically handicapped. Such services must consist of care, research or education in the fields of human health or social adjustment and rehabilitation; relief of victims of natural disasters and other emergencies; or assistance to those who are impoverished and therefore in need of food, shelter, clothing, education, and basic human welfare services.(3) Organizations that seek to influence the outcomes of elections or the determination of public policy through political activity or advocacy, lobbying, or litigation on behalf of parties other than themselves shall not be deemed charitable health and welfare organizations and shall not be eligible to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign.(4) International organizations that pro", "vide health and welfare services overseas, and that meet the eligibility criteria except for the local services criterion, shall be eligible to participate in each local solicitation area of the Combined Federal Campaign.(5) Local voluntary, charitable, health and welfare organizations that are not affiliated with a national organization or federation but that satisfy the eligibility criteria set forth in this order and by the Director shall be permitted to participate in the Combined Federal Campaign.SecSecSec(a) outreach coordinators to conduct campaign promotion in a local Combined Federal Campaign; and(b) central campaign administrators to administer application and pledging systems and to collect and disburse pledged funds.Such authorizations shall, if made, ensure at a minimum that outreach coordinators and central campaign administrators operate subject to the direction and control of the Director and such local Federal coordinating entities as may be established; and manage the Combined Federal Campaign fairly and equitably.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination;\u201c(2) Congress has heard testimony from individuals, including representatives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Federation of Government Employees, that point to chronic problems of discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees;\u201c(3) in August 2000, a jury found that the Environmental Protection Agency had discriminated against a senior social scientist, and awarded that scientist $600,000;\u201c(4) in October 2000, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigation found that the Environmental Protection Agency had retaliated against a senior scientist for disagreeing with that agency on a matter of science and for helping Congress to carry out its oversight responsibilities;\u201c(5) there have been several recent class action suits based on discrimination brought against Federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Marshals Service, the ", "Department of Agriculture, the United States Information Agency, and the Social Security Administration;\u201c(6) notifying Federal employees of their rights under discrimination and whistleblower laws should increase Federal agency compliance with the law;\u201c(7) requiring annual reports to Congress on the number and severity of discrimination and whistleblower cases brought against each Federal agency should enable Congress to improve its oversight over compliance by agencies with the law; and\u201c(8) requiring Federal agencies to pay for any discrimination or whistleblower judgment, award, or settlement should improve agency accountability with respect to discrimination and whistleblower laws.\u201cSEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\u201cIt is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court judgments or settlements relating to discrimination and whistleblower laws by targeting the claimant or other employees with reductions in compensation, benefits, or workforce to pay for such judgments or settlements;\u201c(2) the mission of the Federal agency and the employment security of employees who are blameless in a whistleblower incident should not be compromised;\u201c(3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in force or furloughs as means of funding a reimbursement under this Act;\u201c(4) accountability in the enforcement of the rights of Federal employees is furthered when Federal agencies agree to take appropriate disciplinary action against Federal employees who are found to have intentionally committed discriminatory (including retaliatory) acts;\u201c(5)(A) accountability is not furthered if Federal agencies react to the increased accountability under this Act for what, by law, the agency is responsible by taking unfounded disciplinary actions against managers or by violating the procedural rights of managers who have been accused of discrimination; and\u201c(B) Federal agencies should ensure that managers have adequate training in the management of a diverse workforce and in dispute resolution and other essential communic", "ation skills; and\u201c(6)(A) Federal agencies are expected to reimburse the General Fund of the Treasury within a reasonable time under this Act; and\u201c(B) a Federal agency, particularly if the amount of reimbursement under this Act is large relative to annual appropriations for that agency, may need to extend reimbursement over several years in order to avoid\u2014\u201c(i) reductions in force;\u201c(ii) furloughs;\u201c(iii) other reductions in compensation or benefits for the workforce of the agency; or\u201c(iv) an adverse effect on the mission of the agency.\u201cSEC. 103.

Leading companies in the private sector are free to provide to same-sex domestic partners the same benefits they provide to married people of the opposite sex. Executive departments and agencies, however, may only provide benefits on that basis if they have legal authorization to do so. My Administration is not authorized by Federal law to extend a number of available Federal benefits to the same-sex partners of Federal employees. Within existing law, however, my Administration, in consultation with the Secretary of State, who oversees our Foreign Service employees, and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, who oversees human resource management for our civil service employees, has identified areas in which statutory authority exists to achieve greater equality for the Federal workforce through extension to same-sex domestic partners of benefits currently available to married people of the opposite sex. Extending available benefits will help the Federal Government compete with the private sector to recruit and retain the best and the brightest employees.I", " hereby request the following:SectionExtension of Identified BenefitsSecReview of Governmentwide BenefitsSecPromoting Compliance with Existing Law Requiring Federal Workplaces to be Free of Discrimination Based on Non-Merit Factors5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(10)SecGeneral Provisions(i) Authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) Functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.SecPublication\nBarack Obama.\nExtension of Benefits to Same-Sex Domestic Partners of Federal EmployeesMemorandum of President of the United States, June 2, 2010Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesFor far too long, many of our Government\u2019s hard-working, dedicated LGBT employees have been denied equal access to the basic rights and benefits their colleagues enjoy. This kind of systemic inequality undermines the health, well-being, and security not just of our Federal workforce, but also of their families and communities. That is why, last June, I directed the heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies), in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), to conduct a thorough review of the benefits they provide and to identify any that could be extended to LGBT employees and their partners and families. Although legislative action is necessary to provide full equality to LGBT Federal employees, the agencies have identified a number of benefits that can be extended under existing law. OPM, in consultation with the Department of Justice, has provided me with a report recommending that all of the i", "dentified benefits be extended.Accordingly, I hereby direct the following:SectionImmediate Actions To Extend Benefits(a) The Director of OPM should take appropriate action to:(i) clarify that the children of employees\u2019 same-sex domestic partners fall within the definition of \u201cchild\u201d for purposes of Federal child-care subsidies, and, where appropriate, for child-care services;(ii) clarify that, for purposes of employee assistance programs, same-sex domestic partners and their children qualify as \u201cfamily members\u201d;(iii) issue a proposed rule that would clarify that employees\u2019 same-sex domestic partners qualify as \u201cfamily members\u201d for purposes of noncompetitive appointments made pursuant to Executive Order 12721 of July 30, 1990(iv) issue a proposed rule that would add a Federal retiree\u2019s same-sex domestic partner to the list of individuals presumed to have an insurable interest in the employee pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8339(k)(1)(v) clarify that under appropriate circumstances, employees\u2019 same-sex domestic partners and their children qualify as dependents for purposes of evacuation payments made under 5 U.S.C. 5522\u2013552(vi) amend its guidance on implementing President Clinton\u2019s April 11, 1997(vii) clarify that employees\u2019 same-sex domestic partners qualify as dependents for purposes of calculating the extra allowance payable under 5 U.S.C. 5942a(b) The Administrator of General Services should take appropriate action to amend the definitions of \u201cimmediate family\u201d and \u201cdependent\u201d appearing in the Federal Travel Regulations, 41 C.F.R.

No. 13714. Strengthening the Senior Executive ServiceEx. Ord. No. 13714, Dec. 15, 2015By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, in order to strengthen the recruitment, hiring, and development of the Federal Government\u2019s senior executives; I hereby order as follows:SectionPolicyAugust 18, 2011Section 2 of this order establishes, under the President\u2019s Management Council (PMC), a Subcommittee to advise the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the PMC, and the President on senior executive matters, help monitor execution of an important set of executive reforms contained in section 3 of this order, and help keep the Federal Government\u2019s executive management practices current and effective. In order to identify and maximize the use of best practices, requirements in sections [sic] 3(b)(i)\u2013(iv) of this order will be implemented in three phases, with Phase I consisting of seven agencies, which will execute those reforms in fiscal year (FY) 2016; Phase II consisting of seven agencies, which will execute those reforms in FY 2017; and Phase III consisting of all other agencies, which will execute those reforms in FY 2018.SecEstablishment of PMC Subcommittee to Strengthen the Senior Executive ServiceSecRequirements(a) Actions for Immediate Government-wide Implementation.(i) Starting in FY 2017, agencies should limit their aggregate spending on agency performance awards for SES and Senior Level (SL) and Senior Scientific or Professional (ST) employees to 7.5 percent of aggregate SES and SL/ST salaries respectively. OMB and OPM shall undertake a review of, and revise as appropriate, their current guidance regarding aggregate spending on such awards. In addition, agencies should allocate awards in a manner that provides meaningfully greater rewards to top p", "erformers. Within 120 days of the date of this order, OPM shall issue, as appropriate, additional guidance regarding the distribution of such awards.(ii) The heads of agencies with SES positions that supervise General Schedule (GS) employees shall implement policies, as permitted by and consistent with applicable law and regulation, for initial pay setting and pay adjustments, as appropriate, for career SES appointees to result in compensation exceeding the rates of pay, including locality pay, of their subordinate GS employees. Similar policies shall be implemented by heads of agencies for Senior Professional (i.e., SL or ST) employees that supervise GS employees. Such policies and practices support, recognize, and reward agency executives, especially top performers, in a manner commensurate with their roles, responsibilities, and contributions, and may increase the competitiveness of SES positions with comparable positions outside of Government.(iii) Within 90 days of the date of this order, OPM shall evaluate the current Qualifications Review Board (QRB) process and issue guidance to agencies about materials that would be acceptable for QRB consideration and that will serve as an alternative or replacement to the current lengthy essay requirement for QRB submission, which may deter qualified applicants for SES positions or put an additional burden on human resources staff. The guidance shall also advise agencies about ways to streamline their initial application requirements for SES positions, including evaluation of options, such as allowing individuals to apply by only submitting a resume-based application and any additional materials necessary to determine relevant qualifications, consistent with the new QRB submission requirements.(iv) Within 120 days of OPM issuing the guidance described in section 3(a)(iii) of this order, the heads of agencies with SES positions shall examine the agency\u2019s career SES hiring process and make changes to the process to make it more efficient, effective, and less burdensome f", "or all participants. Agencies shall simplify the initial application requirements for SES positions consistent with the guidance issued in section 3(a)(iii) of this order, and should only request critically necessary technical qualifications, with the goal of minimizing requirements that may deter qualified applicants from applying. Agencies shall also monitor time to hire of SES positions, and identify appropriate process improvements or other changes that can help reduce time to hire while ensuring high quality of hires.(v) By May 31, 2016(b) Actions for Phased ImplementationSeptember 30, 2016September 30, 2017September 30, 2018(i) Establish an annual talent management and succession planning process to assess the development needs of all SES members, and SL and ST employees as appropriate, to inform readiness decisions about hiring, career development, and executive reassignments and rotations. These assessments shall include input from each executive, as well as the executive\u2019s supervisor, and shall be used to recommend development activities and inform the organization\u2019s succession planning, decisions about duty assignments, and agency hiring plans;(ii) Proactively recruit individuals for vacant SES positions and regularly review those recruitment efforts at the Deputy Secretary (or direct designee) level on at least a quarterly basis, consistent with existing rules and regulations. Establish a mechanism to track, and raise for appropriate senior-level attention, information about each position that agencies are seeking to fill, including, at a minimum, source of the recruitment, number, quality and diversity (as available) of applicants, source of applicants (subcomponent, agency or non-government), and timeliness of the hiring process. Use the talent management and succession planning process described in section 3(b)(i) of this order and agency hiring plans to inform these recruitment efforts; and develop a tailored outreach strategy for proactive recruitment for key strategic positions;(iii) Require supe", "rvisors of executives in their agency to work with their subordinate executives to update EDPs for each executive required by 5 CFR part 412.401, to include at least one developmental activity annually and at least one leadership assessment involving employee feedback (for example, 360 degree-type reviews) every 3 years to inform each executive\u2019s developmental needs. In addition, non-career SES and equivalent appointees should also have one leadership assessment during their first 2 years, and additional assessments every 3 years thereafter; and(iv) Establish a formal Executive Onboarding Program informed by OPM\u2019s Enhanced Executive Onboarding Model and Government-Wide Executive Onboarding Framework, which shall provide critical support and guidance to executives through their first year of service in new positions, consistent with guidance to be issued by OPM no later than 60 days after the date of this order. Onboarding shall be provided for career and non-career SES, SL and ST employees, and SES-equivalent positions.SecAdditional Implementation ConsiderationsActions for Agencies with SES-Equivalent Positions(b) Agency Status and ReportingSecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f3132.

No. 13932, June 26, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3SectionPurposeAmerica\u2019s private employers have modernized their recruitment practices to better identify and secure talent through skills- and competency-based hiring. As the modern workforce evolves, the Federal Government requires a more efficient approach to hiring. Employers adopting skills- and competency-based hiring recognize that an overreliance on college degrees excludes capable candidates and undermines labor-market efficiencies. Degree-based hiring is especially likely to exclude qualified candidates for jobs related to emerging technologies and those with weak connections between educational attainment and the skills or competencies required to perform them. Moreover, unnecessary obstacles to opportunity disproportionately burden low-income Americans and decrease economic mobility.The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) oversees most aspects of the civilian Federal workforce, including creating and maintaining the General Schedule classification system and determining the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements for Federal jobs. Executive departments and agencies (agencies), however, are responsible for vetting and selecting specific candidates to fill particular job openings consistent with statutory requirements and OPM rules and guidance, including applicable minimum educational requirements. Currently, for most Federal jobs, traditional education\u2014high school, college, or graduate-level\u2014rather than experiential learning is either an absolute requirement or the only path to consideration for candidates without many years of", " experience. As a result, Federal hiring practices currently lag behind those of private sector leaders in securing talent based on skills and competency.My Administration is committed to modernizing and reforming civil service hiring through improved identification of skills requirements and effective assessments of the skills job seekers possess. We encourage these same practices in the private sector. Modernizing our country\u2019s processes for identifying and hiring talent will provide America a more inclusive and demand-driven labor force.Through the work of the National Council for the American Worker and the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, my Administration is fulfilling its commitment to expand employment opportunities for workers. The increased adoption of apprenticeship programs by American employers, the creation of Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, and the implementation of Federal hiring reforms, including those in this order, represent important steps toward providing more Americans with pathways to family-sustaining careers. In addition, the Principles on Workforce Freedom and Mobility announced by my Administration in January 2020 detail reforms that will expand opportunities and eliminate unnecessary education costs for job seekers. This order builds on the broader work of my Administration to expand opportunity and create a more inclusive 21st-century economy.This order directs important, merit-based reforms that will replace degree-based hiring with skills- and competency-based hiring and will hold the civil service to a higher standard\u2014ensuring that the individuals most capable of performing the roles and responsibilities required of a specific position are those hired for that position\u2014that is more in line with the principles on which the merit system rests.Sec.Revision of Job Classification and Qualification StandardsJune 26, 2020(i) An agency may prescribe a minimum educational requirement for employment in the Federal competitive service only when a minimum educational qua", "lification is legally required to perform the duties of the position in the State or locality where those duties are to be performed.(ii) Unless an agency is determining a candidate\u2019s satisfaction of a legally required minimum educational requirement, an agency may consider education in determining a candidate\u2019s satisfaction of some other minimum qualification only if the candidate\u2019s education directly reflects the competencies necessary to satisfy that qualification and perform the duties of the position.(b) Position descriptions and job postings published by agencies for positions within the competitive service should be based on the specific skills and competencies required to perform those jobs.Sec.Improving the Use of Assessments in the Federal Hiring Process(b) In assessing candidates, agencies shall not rely solely on candidates\u2019 self-evaluations of their stated abilities. Applicants must clear other assessment hurdles in order to be certified for consideration.(c) Agencies shall continually evaluate the effectiveness of different assessment strategies to promote and protect the quality and integrity of their hiring processes.Sec.Definitions(a) the term \u201cassessment\u201d refers to any valid and reliable method of collecting information on an individual for the purposes of making a decision about qualification, hiring, placement, promotion, referral, or entry into programs leading to advancement;(b) the term \u201ccompetitive service\u201d has the meaning specified by section 2102 of title 5(c) the term \u201ceducation\u201d refers to Post High-School Education as that term is defined in the OPM General Schedule Qualification Policies; and(d) the term \u201cqualification\u201d means the minimum requirements necessary to perform work of a particular position or occupation successfully and safely.Sec.General Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposa", "ls.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDonald J.

Yet the co", "mplexity and inefficiency of today\u2019s Federal hiring process deters many highly qualified individuals from seeking and obtaining jobs in the Federal Government.I therefore call on executive departments and agencies (agencies) to overhaul the way they recruit and hire our civilian workforce.

While seeking to employ a talented and productive workforce, it has a responsibility to lead by example. Although executive departments and agencies (agencies) generally can, and do, take job applicants\u2019 employment history and other factors into account when making hiring decisions, it is the policy of my Administration that applicants should not face undue obstacles to Federal employment because they are unemployed or face financial difficulties.

Trump.\nEx. Ord. No. 14100. Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and SurvivorsEx. Ord. No. 14100, June 9, 2023By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyMilitary families, like their civilian counterparts, increasingly look to rely upon dual incomes; however, the 21 percent unemployment rate experienced by active-duty military spouses in the workforce makes that a difficult goal to achieve and maintain. Nearly one in five military families cite challenges with spousal employment as a reason when considering leaving active-duty service. The challenges associated with the military lifestyle, including permanent change-of-station moves every 2 to 3 years on average for active-duty families, mean that military spouses often struggle to find options for work that are portable or allow them to build a sustainable long-term career. Employment challenges are not limited to active-duty spouses, as Reserve and National Guard spouses must balance their careers against the unpredictable nature of the service member\u2019s schedule, activations, and deployments. Employment challenges can continue to affect the employability and career trajectory of veteran spouses well after a service member leaves the service.Recognizing the importance of military family economic well-being to the all-volunteer force, the Federal Government employs more than 16,000 military, veteran, and surviving spouses. As the Nation\u2019s largest employer, we must be a model for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and,", " in doing so, we recognize that military spouses are an underserved community. Whether they choose public service, employment in the private sector, or entrepreneurship through building a small business, it is the policy of my Administration to advance economic opportunity for military spouses. My Administration also recognizes the imperative of promoting economic security for military spouses\u2014the vast majority of whom are women\u2014under the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality.In addition, my Administration understands that access to high-quality, affordable child care is a necessity for working families, and a military readiness issue. While the Department of Defense offers the largest employer-sponsored child care network in the country, military families still face challenges related to capacity and non-traditional work schedules. Many military families seeking care outside of the gates of our military bases struggle to find care they can afford. Because access to child care should not be an impediment to service, I have directed the Secretary of Defense to ensure the Fourteenth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation, undertaken in January 2023, includes an assessment of child care access and cost in its review of military benefits and pay, along with consideration of factors such as the challenge of military spouse unemployment, frequent military moves, and periods of geographic separation between service members and their spouses, including dual military couples.Military spouses can also be service members themselves, wearing the Nation\u2019s uniform in our Active Components, National Guard, or Reserve forces, with a higher percentage of women service members in a dual military marriage than their male counterparts. As we recognize the 75th anniversary of women\u2019s integration into the Armed Forces, my Administration is committed to removing barriers to women\u2019s ability to serve, including difficulty in accessing child care, which poses a challenge for both spouses, but disproportionately affects rete", "ntion for women, especially women in dual military couples, and can play a factor in women\u2019s early separation from the Armed Forces.As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the all-volunteer force, we must appreciate now more than ever that the commitment and resilience of military-connected families are essential to the recruitment, retention, and readiness of our Armed Forces and the enduring strength of our Nation. Meeting the economic, social, and emotional needs of our military and veteran families, military caregivers, and survivors is a national security imperative. In times of peace and of war, military and veteran families, military caregivers, and survivors have sacrificed much for our country, answering the call to duty time and again. We owe them nothing less than the dignity of a meaningful career and the opportunity to build economic security for their families.Sec.Government-wide Military and Veteran Spouse, Military Caregiver, and Survivor Hiring and Retention Strategic Plan and Training(a) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop and issue a Government-wide Military and Veteran Spouse, Military Caregiver, and Survivor Hiring and Retention Strategic Plan (Military-Connected Plan) within 180 days of the date of this order [June 9, 2023August 18, 201142 U.S.C. 2000eJune 25, 202142 U.S.C. 2000e(i) define measures of success for the recruitment, hiring, and retention of military and veteran spouses, military caregivers, and survivors based on leading policies and practices in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors;(ii) include plans for OPM to consult with the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security in developing enhanced support for the retention of military spouses in Federal careers, consistent wit", "h merit system principles as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2301(iii) consistent with merit system principles, identify strategies\u2014including pursuing development of a legislative proposal, as appropriate\u2014to eliminate, where applicable, barriers to the employment of military and veteran spouses, military caregivers, and survivors in the Federal workforce, including with respect to recruitment;

These advances can make Federal employees more productive and provide improved service to our customers, the American taxpayers. We need to ensure that we continue to train Federal employees to take full advantage of these technological advances and to acquire the skills and learning needed to succeed in a changing workplace. A coordinated Federal effort is needed to provide flexible training opportunities to employees and to explore how Federal training programs, initiatives, and policies can better support lifelong learning through the use of learning technology.To help us meet these goals, I am creating a task force on Federal training technology, directing Federal agencies to take certain steps to enhance employees\u2019 training opportunities through the use of training technology, and an advisory committee on the use of training technology, which also will explore options for financing the training and post-secondary education needed to upgrade skills and gain new knowledge.Therefore, by the authority vest", "ed in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended ([former] 5 U.S.C.

I am committed to ending programs that do not work, streamlining those that do, and bringing a new responsibility for stewardship of tax dollars. Like households and businesses across the country, the Federal Government is tightening its belt. This effort began during my first days in office, when I froze the salaries of the senior members of my White House Staff.As a next step in this effort, I direct you to suspend cash awards, quality step increases, bonuses, and similar discretionary payments or salary adjustments to any politically appointed Federal employee, commencing immediately, and continuing through the end of Fiscal Year 2011. I also direct the Office of Personnel Management to issue guidance, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, to assist departments and agencies in implementing this policy.In addition to these actions freezing discretionary payments, I have proposed in my Budget for Fiscal Year 2011 a salary freeze for senior political appointees throughout the Federal Government. Unlike the administrative action I have taken today in this memorandum, my proposed salary freeze requires legislation, so it cannot be implemented absent legislative action by the Congress.I appreciate the hard work of our Federal workforce, and understand how important these payments can be to many workers and their families. Yet like households and businesses across the country, we need to make tough choices about how to spend our funds.This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and consistent with executive departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 legal authorities. Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to affect payments or salary adjustments for Federal employees who are not political appointees. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity", " by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama.

The Congress responded to my proposal by including such a freeze in the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 (H.R. 3082) [Pub. L. 111\u2013322While this legislation will prevent adjustments in executive branch pay schedules that are made by statute, some laws allow such adjustments to be made by agency heads as an exercise of administrative discretion. In order to ensure consistent treatment of executive branch employees and to promote the fiscal purposes of my original proposal, agency heads who have such discretion should not provide any upward adjustments in Federal employees\u2019 pay schedules or rates during the two-year period covered by the statutory pay freeze.Accordingly, you should suspend any increases to any pay systems or pay schedules covering executive branch employees that could otherwise take effect as a result of ", "an exercise of administrative discretion during the period beginning on January 1, 2011December 31, 2012This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and consistent with executive departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 legal authorities.

Rate on change of position or type of appointment; regulations(a) The rate of basic pay to which an employee is entitled is governed by regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management in conformity with this subchapter and chapter 51 of this title when\u2014(1) he is transferred from a position in the legislative, judicial, or executive branch to which this subchapter does not apply;(2) he is transferred from a position in the legislative, judicial, or executive branch to which this subchapter applies to another such position;(3) he is demoted to a position in a lower grade;(4) he is reinstated, reappointed, or reemployed in a position to which this subchapter applies following service in any position in the legislative, judicial, or executive branch;(5) his type of appointment is changed;(6) his employment status is otherwise changed; or(7) his position is changed from one grade to another grade.For the purpose of this subsection, an individual employed by the Appalachian Regional Commission under section 14306(a)(2) of title 40(b) An employee who is promoted or transferred to a position in a higher grade is entitled to basic pay at the lowest rate of the higher grade which exceeds his existi", "ng rate of basic pay by not less than two step-increases of the grade from which he is promoted or transferred. If, in the case of an employee so promoted or transferred who is receiving basic pay at a rate in excess of the maximum rate of his grade, there is no rate in the higher grade which is at least two step-increases above his existing rate of basic pay, he is entitled to\u2014(1) the maximum rate of the higher grade; or(2) his existing rate of basic pay, if that rate is the higher.If an employee so promoted or transferred is receiving basic pay at a rate saved to him under subchapter VI of this chapter on reduction in grade, he is entitled to\u2014(A) basic pay at a rate two steps above the rate which he would be receiving if subchapter VI of this chapter were not applicable to him; or(B) his existing rate of basic pay, if that rate is the higher.If an employee\u2019s rate after promotion or transfer is greater than the maximum rate of basic pay for the employee\u2019s grade, that rate shall be treated as a retained rate under section 5363. The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe by regulation the circumstances under which and the extent to which special rates under section 5305 (or similar provision of law) or locality-adjusted rates under section 5304 (or similar provision of law) are considered to be basic pay in applying this subsection.(c) An employee in the legislative branch who is paid by the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, and who has completed two or more years of service as such an employee, and a Member of the Senate or House of Representatives who has completed two or more years of service as such a Member, may, on appointment to a position to which this subchapter applies, have his initial rate of pay fixed\u2014(1) at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade; or(2) at a step of the appropriate grade that does not exceed the highest previous rate of pay received by him during that service in the legislative branch.(d) The rate of pay established", " for a teaching position as defined by section 901 of title 20(e) An employee of a county committee established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (16 U.S.C. 590h(b)(1) the lowest rate of the higher grade that exceeds the rate of basic pay of the employee with the county committee by not less than 2 step-increases of the grade from which the employee was promoted, if the Federal Civil Service position under this subchapter is at a higher grade than the last grade the employee had while an employee of the county committee;(2) the same step of the grade as the employee last held during service with the county committee, if the Federal Civil Service position under this subchapter is at the same grade as the last grade the employee had while an employee of the county committee; or(3) the lowest step of the Federal grade for which the rate of basic pay is equal to or greater than the highest previous rate of pay of the employee, if the Federal Civil Service position under this subchapter is at a lower grade than the last grade the employee had while an employee of the county committee.(f)(1) An employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard described in section 2105(c) who moves, without a break in service of more than 3 days, to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, that is subject to this subchapter, may have such employee\u2019s initial rate of basic pay fixed at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade or at any step of such grade that does not exceed\u2014(A) if the highest previous rate of basic pay received by that employee during the employee\u2019s service described in section 2105(c) is equal to a rate of the appropriate grade, such rate of the appropriate grade;(B) if the employee\u2019s highest previous rate of basic pay (as described in subparagraph (A)) is between two rates of the appropriate grade, the higher of those two rates; or(C) if the employee\u2019s highest previous rate of basic pay (as des", "cribed in subparagraph (A)) exceeds the maximum rate of the appropriate grade, the maximum rate of the appropriate grade.(2) In the case of a nonappropriated fund employee who is moved involuntarily from such nonappropriated fund instrumentality without a break in service of more than 3 days and without substantial change in duties to a position that is subject to this subchapter, the employee\u2019s pay shall be set at a rate (not above the maximum for the grade, except as may be provided for under section 5365) that is not less than the employee\u2019s rate of basic pay under the nonappropriated fund instrumentality immediately prior to so moving.(g) In the case of an employee who\u2014(1) moves to a new official duty station, and(2) by virtue of such move, becomes subject to a different pay schedule,any rate adjustment under the preceding provisions of this section, with respect to such employee in connection with such move, shall be made\u2014(A) first, by determining the rate of pay to which such employee would be entitled at the new official duty station based on such employee\u2019s position, grade, and step (or relative position in the rate range) before the move, and(B) then, by applying the provisions of this section that would otherwise apply (if any), treating the rate determined under subparagraph (A) as if it were the rate last received by the employee before the rate adjustment.(Pub.
