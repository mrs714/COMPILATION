FindingsCongress finds that\u2014(1) the 2 federally owned airports in the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia constitute an important and growing part of the commerce, transportation, and economic patterns of Virginia, the District of Columbia, and the surrounding region;(2) Baltimore/Washington International Airport, owned and operated by Maryland, is an air transportation facility that provides service to the greater Metropolitan Washington region together with the 2 federally owned airports, and timely Federal-aid grants to Baltimore/Washington International Airport will provide additional capacity to meet the growing air traffic needs and to compete with other airports on a fair basis;(3) the United States Government has a continuing but limited interest in the operation of the 2 federally owned airports, which serve the travel and cargo needs of the entire Metropolitan Washington region as well as the District of Columbia as the national seat of government", ";(4) operation of the Metropolitan Washington Airports by an independent local authority will facilitate timely improvements at both airports to meet the growing demand of interstate air transportation occasioned by the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95\u201350492 Stat. 1705(5) all other major air carrier airports in the United States are operated by public entities at the State, regional, or local level;(6) any change in status of the 2 airports must take into account the interest of nearby communities, the traveling public, air carriers, general aviation, airport employees, and other interested groups, as well as the interests of the United States Government and State governments involved;(7) in recognition of a perceived limited need for a Federal role in the management of these airports and the growing local interest, the Secretary of Transportation has recommended a transfer of authority from the Federal to the local/State level that is consistent with the management of major airports elsewhere in the United States;(8) an operating authority with representation from local jurisdictions, similar to authorities at all major airports in the United States, will improve communications with local officials and concerned residents regarding noise at the Metropolitan Washington Airports;(9) a commission of congressional, State, and local officials and aviation representatives has recommended to the Secretary that transfer of the federally owned airports be as a unit to an independent authority to be created by Virginia and the District of Columbia; and(10) the Federal interest in these airports can be provided through a lease mechanism which provides for local control and operation.(Added Pub.

Findings and declarations of fact\nThe Congress finds and declares that the Communist Party of the United States, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States. It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship within a republic, demanding for itself the rights and privileges accorded to political parties, but denying to all others the liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. Unlike political parties, which evolve their policies and programs through public means, by the reconciliation of a wide variety of individual views, an", "d submit those policies and programs to the electorate at large for approval or disapproval, the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders of the world Communist movement. Its members have no part in determining its goals, and are not permitted to voice dissent to party objectives. Unlike members of political parties, members of the Communist Party are recruited for indoctrination with respect to its objectives and methods, and are organized, instructed, and disciplined to carry into action slavishly the assignments given them by their hierarchical chieftains. Unlike political parties, the Communist Party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations upon its conduct or upon that of its members. The Communist Party is relatively small numerically, and gives scant indication of capacity ever to attain its ends by lawful political means. The peril inherent in its operation arises not from its numbers, but from its failure to acknowledge any limitation as to the nature of its activities, and its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence. Holding that doctrine, its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger to the security of the United States. It is the means whereby individuals are seduced into the service of the world Communist movement, trained to do its bidding, and directed and controlled in the conspiratorial performance of their revolutionary services. Therefore, the Communist Party should be outlawed.(Aug. 24, 1954, ch. 886, \u00a7\u202f268 Stat. 775\nEditorial NotesCodificationSection was enacted as part of the Communist Control Act of 1954, and not as part of the Internal Security Act of 1950 which comprises subchapters I to III of this chapter.Statutory Notes and Related SubsidiariesShort TitleFor short title of this subchapter as the \u201cCommu", "nist Control Act of 1954\u201d, see section 1 of act Aug. 24, 1954section 781 of this titleSeparabilityAct Aug. 24, 1954, ch. 886, \u00a7\u202f1268 Stat. 780\u201cIf any provision of this title [see Short Title note above] or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of the title and the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby.\u201dThe use of the word \u201cAct\u201d, in place of the word \u201ctitle\u201d as used in section 12 of act of Aug. 24, 1954 \u00a7\u202f842.

Biden, Jr.\nEx. Ord. No. 13920. Securing the United States Bulk-Power SystemEx. Ord. No. 13920, May 1, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701et seq50 U.S.C. 1601et seqsection 301 of title 3I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, find that foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in the United States bulk-power system, which provides the electricity that supports our national defense, vital emergency services, critical infrastructure, economy, and way of life. The bulk-power system is a target of those seeking to commit malicious acts against the United States and its people, including malicious cyber activities, because a successful attack on our bulk-power system would present significant risks to our economy, human health and safety, and would render the United States less capable of acting in defense of itself and its allies. I further find that the unrestricted acquisition or use in the United States of bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to t", "he jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries augments the ability of foreign adversaries to create and exploit vulnerabilities in bulk-power system electric equipment, with potentially catastrophic effects. I therefore determine that the unrestricted foreign supply of bulk-power system electric equipment constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, which has its source in whole or in substantial part outside the United States. This threat exists both in the case of individual acquisitions and when acquisitions are considered as a class. Although maintaining an open investment climate in bulk-power system electric equipment, and in the United States economy more generally, is important for the overall growth and prosperity of the United States, such openness must be balanced with the need to protect our Nation against a critical national security threat. To address this threat, additional steps are required to protect the security, integrity, and reliability of bulk-power system electric equipment used in the United States. In light of these findings, I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to the threat to the United States bulk-power system.Accordingly, I hereby order:SectionProhibitions and ImplementationMay 1, 2020(i) the transaction involves bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary; and(ii) the transaction:(A) poses an undue risk of sabotage to or subversion of the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of the bulk-power system in the United States;(B) poses an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of United States critical infrastructure or the economy of the United States; or(C) otherwise poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and s", "afety of United States persons.(b) The Secretary, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, may at the Secretary\u2019s discretion design or negotiate measures to mitigate concerns identified under section 1(a) of this order. Such measures may serve as a precondition to the approval by the Secretary of a transaction or of a class of transactions that would otherwise be prohibited pursuant to this order.(c) The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the date of this order.(d) The Secretary, in consultation with the heads of other agencies as appropriate, may establish and publish criteria for recognizing particular equipment and particular vendors in the bulk-power system electric equipment market as pre-qualified for future transactions; and may apply these criteria to establish and publish a list of pre-qualified equipment and vendors. Nothing in this provision limits the Secretary\u2019s authority under this section to prohibit or otherwise regulate any transaction involving pre-qualified equipment or vendors.Sec.Authorities(b) Rules and regulations issued pursuant to this order may, among other things, determine that particular countries or persons are foreign adversaries exclusively for the purposes of this order; identify persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries exclusively for the purposes of this order; identify particular equipment or countries with respect to which transactions involving bulk-power system electric equipment warrant particular scrutiny under the provisions of this order; establish procedures to license transactions otherwise prohibited pursuant to this order; and identify a mechanism and relevant factors for the negotiation of agreements to mitigate concerns raised in connection with", " subsection 1(a) of this order. Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and, as appropriate, the heads of other agencies, shall publish rules or regulations implementing the authorities delegated to the Secretary by this order.(c) The Secretary may, consistent with applicable law, redelegate any of the authorities conferred on the Secretary pursuant to this section within the Department of Energy.(d) As soon as practicable, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the heads of such other agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate, shall:(i) identify bulk-power system electric equipment designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary that poses an undue risk of sabotage to or subversion of the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of the bulk-power system in the United States, poses an undue risk of catastrophic effects on the security or resiliency of United States critical infrastructure or the economy of the United States, or otherwise poses an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons; and(ii) develop recommendations on ways to identify, isolate, monitor, or replace such items as soon as practicable, taking into consideration overall risk to the bulk-power system.Sec.Task Force on Federal Energy Infrastructure Procurement Policies Related to National Security(b) In addition to the Chair of the Task Force (Chair), the Task Force membership shall include the following heads of agencies, or their designees:(i) the Secretary of Defense;(ii) the Secreta", "ry of the Interior;(iii) the Secretary of Commerce;(iv) the Secretary of Homeland Security;(v) the Director of National Intelligence;(vi) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and(vii) the head of any other agency that the Chair may designate in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior.(c) The Task Force shall:(i) develop a recommended consistent set of energy infrastructure procurement policies and procedures for agencies, to the extent consistent with law, to ensure that national security considerations are fully integrated across the Federal Government, and submit such recommendations to the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council);(ii) evaluate the methods and criteria used to incorporate national security considerations into energy security and cybersecurity policymaking;(iii) consult with the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council and the Oil and Natural Gas Subsector Coordinating Council in developing the recommendations and evaluation described in subsections (c)(i) through (ii) of this section; and(iv) conduct any other studies, develop any other recommendations, and submit any such studies and recommendations to the President, as appropriate and as directed by the Secretary.(d) The Department of Energy shall provide administrative support and funding for the Task Force, to the extent consistent with applicable law.(e) The Task Force shall meet as required by the Chair and, unless extended by the Chair, shall terminate once it has accomplished the objectives set forth in subsection (c) of this section, as determined by the Chair, and completed the reports described in subsection (f) of this section.(f) The Task Force shall submit to the President, through the Chair and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget:(i) a report within 1 year from the date of this order [May 1, 2020(ii) a subsequent report at least once annually thereafter while the Task Force remains in existence; and(iii) such other reports as appropriate and as dir", "ected by the Chair.(g) In the reports submitted under subsection (f) of this section, the Task Force shall summarize its progress, findings, and recommendations described in subsection (c) of this section.(h) Because attacks on the bulk-power system can originate through the distribution system, the Task Force shall engage with distribution system industry groups, to the extent consistent with law and national security. Within 180 days of receiving the recommendations pursuant to subsection (c)(i) of this section, the FAR Council shall consider proposing for notice and public comment an amendment to the applicable provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation to implement the recommendations provided pursuant to subsection (c)(i) of this section.Sec.Definitions(a) The term \u201cbulk-power system\u201d means (i) facilities and control systems necessary for operating an interconnected electric energy transmission network (or any portion thereof); and (ii) electric energy from generation facilities needed to maintain transmission reliability.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta\u2019s Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008\u2019.\u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Beginning on August 19, 2007\u201c(A) to demand the release of all political prisoners, including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and\u201c(B) to urge the regime to engage in meaningful dialogue to pursue national reconciliation.\u201c(2) The Burmese regime responded to these peaceful protests with a violent crackdown leading to the reported killing of approximately 200 people, including a Japanese photojournalist, and hundreds of injuries. Human rights groups further estimate that over 2,000 individuals have been detained, arrested, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, or otherwise intimidated as part of this crackdown. Burmese military, police, and their affiliates in the Union Solidarity Development Association (USDA) perpetrated almost all of these abuses. The Burmese regime continues to detain, torture, and otherwise intimidate those individuals whom [sic] it believes participated in or led the protests and it has closed down or otherwise limited access to several monasteries and temples that played key roles in the peaceful protests.\u201c(3) The Department of State\u2019s 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices found that the SPDC\u2014\u201c(A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement;\u201c(B) traffics in persons;\u201c(C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;\u201c(D) forc", "ibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and\u201c(E) commits other serious violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for political motives.\u201c(4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or held under house arrest for more than 12 years.\u201c(5) In October 2007, President Bush announced a new Executive Order to tighten economic sanctions against Burma and block property and travel to the United States by certain senior leaders of the SPDC, individuals who provide financial backing for the SPDC, and individuals responsible for human rights violations and impeding democracy in Burma. Additional names were added in updates done on October 19, 2007February 5, 2008\u201c(6) The Burmese regime and its supporters finance their ongoing violations of human rights, undemocratic policies, and military activities in part through financial transactions, travel, and trade involving the United States, including the sale of petroleum products, gemstones and hardwoods.\u201c(7) In 2006, the Burmese regime earned more than $500 million from oil and gas projects, over $500 million from sale of hardwoods, and in excess of $300 million from the sale of rubies and jade. At least $500 million of the $2.16 billion earned in 2006 from Burma\u2019s two natural gas pipelines, one of which is 28 percent owned by a United States company, went to the Burmese regime. The regime has earned smaller amounts from oil and gas exploration and non-operational pipelines but United States investors are not involved in those transactions. Industry sources estimate that over $100 million annually in Burmese rubies and jade enters the United States. Burma\u2019s official statistics report that Burma exported $500 million in hardwoods in 2006 but NGOs estimate the true figure to exceed $900 million. Reliable statistics on the amount of hardwoods imported into the United States from Burma in the form of finished products are not", " available, in part due to widespread illegal logging and smuggling.\u201c(8) The SPDC seeks to evade the sanctions imposed in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 [Pub. L. 108\u201361\u201c(9) According to hardwood industry experts, Burma is home to approximately 60 percent of the world\u2019s native teak reserves. More than \u00bc of the world\u2019s internationally traded teak originates from Burma, and hardwood sales, mainly of teak, represent more than 11 percent of Burma\u2019s official foreign exchange earnings.\u201c(10) The SPDC owns a majority stake in virtually all enterprises responsible for the extraction and trade of Burmese natural resources, including all mining operations, the Myanmar Timber Enterprise, the Myanmar Gems Enterprise, the Myanmar Pearl Enterprise, and the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise. Virtually all profits from these enterprises enrich the SPDC.\u201c(11) On October 11, 2007\u201c(12) The United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari traveled to Burma from September 29, 2007October 2, 2007\u201c(13) The leaders of the SPDC will have a greater incentive to cooperate with diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the People\u2019s Republic of China if they come under targeted economic pressure that denies them access to personal wealth and sources of revenue.\u201c(14) On the night of May 2, 2008May 3, 2008\u201c(15) The response to the cyclone by Burma\u2019s military leaders illustrates their fundamental lack of concern for the welfare of the Burmese people. The regime did little to warn citizens of the cyclone, did not provide adequate humanitarian assistance to address basic needs and prevent loss of life, and continues to fail to provide life-protecting and life-sustaining services to its people.\u201c(16) The international community responded immediately to the cyclone and attempted to provide humanitarian assistance. More than 30 disaster assessment teams from 18 different nations and the United Nations arrived in the region, but the Burmese regime denied them permission to enter the country. Eventu", "ally visas were granted to aid workers, but the regime continues to severely limit their ability to provide assistance in the affected areas.\u201c(17) Despite the devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis, the junta went ahead with its referendum on a constitution drafted by an illegitimate assembly, conducting voting in unaffected areas on May 10, 2008May 26, 2008\u201cSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has failed to transfer power to the National League for Democracy (NLD) whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in the 1990 elections in Burma.\u201c(2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail to further such dialogue.\u201c(3) According to the ", "State Department\u2019s \u2018Report to the Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward Burma\u2019 dated March 28, 2003\u201c(4) On May 30, 2003\u201c(5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly conscripts child-soldiers for the use in fighting indigenous ethnic groups.\u201c(6) The SPDC is engaged in ethnic cleansing against minorities within Burma, including the Karen, Karenni, and Shan people, which constitutes a crime against humanity and has directly led to more than 600,000 internally displaced people living within Burma and more than 130,000 people from Burma living in refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border.\u201c(7) The ethnic cleansing campaign of the SPDC is in sharp contrast to the traditional peaceful coexistence in Burma of Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and people of traditional beliefs.\u201c(8) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to cooperate with the United States in stopping the flood of heroin and methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to flood the region and much of the world with these illicit drugs.\u201c(9) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment by United States authorities, and other producers and traffickers of narcotics.\u201c(10) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the first time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a resolution recommending that governments, employers, and workers organizations take appropriate measures to ensure that their relations with the SPDC do not abet the government-sponsored system of forced, compulsory, or slave labor in Burma, and that other international bodies reconsider any cooperation they may be engaged in with Burma and, if appropriate, cease as soon as possible any activity that could abet the practice of forced, compulsory, or slave labor.\u201c(11) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its surro", "gates into all facets of the economy effectively destroying any free enterprise system.\u201c(12) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from them serve to provide the SPDC with currency that is used to finance its instruments of terror and repression against the Burmese people.\u201c(13) On April 15, 2003\u201c(14) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the President on April 24, 2003\u201c(15) The United States must work closely with other nations, including Thailand, a close ally of the United States, to highlight attention to the SPDC\u2019s systematic abuses of human rights in Burma, to ensure that nongovernmental organizations promoting human rights and political freedom in Burma are allowed to operate freely and without harassment, and to craft a multilateral sanctions regime against Burma in order to pressure the SPDC to meet the conditions identified in section 3(a)(3) of this Act.\u201cSEC. 3.

The United States has numerous frameworks, including laws and policies, through which to respond to and address CRSV, but more action is required to use them fully and in a manner that responds to the full scale of this problem. These efforts to address impunity and increase accountability for CRSV will complement a broader, holistic approach to preventing and responding to this scourge, which includes advancing gender equity and equality; prioritizing the immediate needs of survivors; and amplifying survivor voices in transitional justice, the provision of services, and peace and political processes.It is the policy of the United States to fully exercise existing authorities to impose economic sanctions and implement visa restrictions in order to promote justice and accountability for acts of CRSV; devote the necessary resources to ensure regular coordination and reporting on C", "RSV incidents and to conduct training on CRSV issues more broadly, including to support the designation of sanctions targets; strengthen the implementation of other existing tools and authorities to promote accountability for CRSV, including the provision of United States security assistance; and broaden engagement with foreign partner governments to encourage the establishment and use of their own tools to promote justice and accountability.Sec.Advancing Accountability for Acts of CRSV through Existing Sanctions AuthoritiesDecember 20, 2017Public Law 114\u201332822 U.S.C. 10101(b) In addition to the authorities described in subsection (a) of this section, many country-specific sanctions programs also contain criteria for the imposition of sanctions on persons engaged in or otherwise connected to activities that may include CRSV. For example, numerous sanctions programs, including country-specific programs related to Belarus, Burma, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Libya, Mali, Nicaragua, Somalia, North Korea, the Russian Federation, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, the Western Balkans, and Zimbabwe, include criteria for targeting certain abuses or violations of human rights, which may include CRSV depending on specific facts and circumstances. It is the policy of the United States to promote accountability for perpetrators of acts of CRSV through relevant existing sanctions authorities, where applicable, and to ensure that these authorities are used to the fullest extent possible to target perpetrators of acts of CRSV and their enablers.(c) I hereby direct the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence to undertake the following actions, including by issuing guidance or regulations as appropriate:(i) ensure equal consideration of and attention to acts of CRSV as the conduct supporting designation when identifying appropriate targets and compiling information necessary for the preparation of sanctions package", "s under applicable authorities, including those identified in this section; and(ii) strengthen the capacity of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to collect, identify, assess, and share information on CRSV as appropriate, including by consulting with local civil society organizations, taking into account the importance of safely gathering information from survivors to support potential designations under existing sanctions authorities.Sec.Advancing Accountability for Acts of CRSV Through Additional Measures and Authorities22 U.S.C. 2378d10 U.S.C. 3628 U.S.C. 1182136 Stat. 664Public Law 117\u2013103Public Law 117\u2013180Sec.Building Coalitions of Like-Minded Nations and Engaging International Organizations in Promoting Accountability for Acts of CRSVSec.DefinitionSec.General Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(d) The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nJ.R.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Beginning on August 19, 2007\u201c(A) to demand the release of all political prisoners, including 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi; and\u201c(B) to urge the regime to engage in meaningful dialogue to pursue national reconciliation.\u201c(2) The Burmese regime responded to these peaceful protests with a violent crackdown leading to the reported killing of approximately 200 people, including a Japanese photojournalist, and hundreds of injuries. Human rights groups further estimate that over 2,000 individuals have been detained, arrested, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, or otherwise intimidated as part of this crackdown. Burmese military, police, and their affiliates in the Union Solidarity Development Association (USDA) perpetrated almost all of these abuses. The Burmese regime continues to detain, torture, and otherwise intimidate those individuals whom [sic] it believes participated in or led the protests and it has closed down or otherwise limited access to several monasteries and temples that played key roles in the peaceful protests.\u201c(3) The Department of State\u2019s 2006 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices found that the SPDC\u2014\u201c(A) routinely restricts freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement;\u201c(B) traffics in persons;\u201c(C) discriminates against women and ethnic minorities;\u201c(D) forcibly recruits child soldiers and child labor; and\u201c(E) commits other serious violations of human rights, including extrajudicial killings, custodial deaths, disappearances, rape, torture, abuse of prisoners and detainees, and the imprisonment of citizens arbitrarily for political motives.\u201c(4) Aung San Suu Kyi has been arbitrarily imprisoned or held under house arrest for more than 12 years.\u201c(5) In October 2007, President Bush announced a new Executive Order to tighten economic sanctions against Burma and block property and travel to the United", " States by certain senior leaders of the SPDC, individuals who provide financial backing for the SPDC, and individuals responsible for human rights violations and impeding democracy in Burma. Additional names were added in updates done on October 19, 2007February 5, 2008\u201c(6) The Burmese regime and its supporters finance their ongoing violations of human rights, undemocratic policies, and military activities in part through financial transactions, travel, and trade involving the United States, including the sale of petroleum products, gemstones and hardwoods.\u201c(7) In 2006, the Burmese regime earned more than $500 million from oil and gas projects, over $500 million from sale of hardwoods, and in excess of $300 million from the sale of rubies and jade. At least $500 million of the $2.16 billion earned in 2006 from Burma\u2019s two natural gas pipelines, one of which is 28 percent owned by a United States company, went to the Burmese regime. The regime has earned smaller amounts from oil and gas exploration and non-operational pipelines but United States investors are not involved in those transactions. Industry sources estimate that over $100 million annually in Burmese rubies and jade enters the United States. Burma\u2019s official statistics report that Burma exported $500 million in hardwoods in 2006 but NGOs estimate the true figure to exceed $900 million. Reliable statistics on the amount of hardwoods imported into the United States from Burma in the form of finished products are not available, in part due to widespread illegal logging and smuggling.\u201c(8) The SPDC seeks to evade the sanctions imposed in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 [Pub. L. 108\u201361\u201c(9) According to hardwood industry experts, Burma is home to approximately 60 percent of the world\u2019s native teak reserves.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has failed to transfer power to the National League for Democracy (NLD) whose parliamentarians won an overwhelming victory in the 1990 elections in Burma.\u201c(2) The SPDC has failed to enter into meaningful, political dialogue with the NLD and ethnic minorities and has dismissed the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Razali bin Ismail to further such dialogue.\u201c(3) According to the State Department\u2019s \u2018Report to the Congress Regarding Conditions in Burma and U.S. Policy Toward Burma\u2019 dated March 28, 2003\u201c(4) On May 30, 2003\u201c(5) The SPDC continues egregious human rights violations against Burmese citizens, uses rape as a weapon of intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly conscripts child-soldiers for the use in fighting indigenous ethnic groups.\u201c(6) The SPDC is engaged in ethnic cleansing against minorities within Burma, including the Karen, Karenni, and Shan people, which constitutes a crime against humanity and has directly led to more than 600,000 internally displaced people living within Burma and more than 130,000 people from Burma living in refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border.\u201c(7) The ethnic cleansing campaign of the SPDC is in sharp contrast to the traditional peaceful coexistence in Burma of Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and people of traditional beliefs.\u201c(8) The SPDC has demonstrably failed to coope", "rate with the United States in stopping the flood of heroin and methamphetamines being grown, refined, manufactured, and transported in areas under the control of the SPDC serving to flood the region and much of the world with these illicit drugs.\u201c(9) The SPDC provides safety, security, and engages in business dealings with narcotics traffickers under indictment by United States authorities, and other producers and traffickers of narcotics.\u201c(10) The International Labor Organization (ILO), for the first time in its 82-year history, adopted in 2000, a resolution recommending that governments, employers, and workers organizations take appropriate measures to ensure that their relations with the SPDC do not abet the government-sponsored system of forced, compulsory, or slave labor in Burma, and that other international bodies reconsider any cooperation they may be engaged in with Burma and, if appropriate, cease as soon as possible any activity that could abet the practice of forced, compulsory, or slave labor.\u201c(11) The SPDC has integrated the Burmese military and its surrogates into all facets of the economy effectively destroying any free enterprise system.\u201c(12) Investment in Burmese companies and purchases from them serve to provide the SPDC with currency that is used to finance its instruments of terror and repression against the Burmese people.\u201c(13) On April 15, 2003\u201c(14) The policy of the United States, as articulated by the President on April 24, 2003\u201c(15) The United States must work closely with other nations, including Thailand, a close ally of the United States, to highlight attention to the SPDC\u2019s systematic abuses of human rights in Burma, to ensure that nongovernmental organizations promoting human rights and political freedom in Burma are allowed to operate freely and without harassment, and to craft a multilateral sanctions regime against Burma in order to pressure the SPDC to meet the conditions identified in section 3(a)(3) of this Act. \u201cSEC. 3.
