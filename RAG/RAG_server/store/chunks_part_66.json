["y;(4) committed a crime of violence that constitutes a felony while on release pending trial, sentence, or appeal from a Federal, State, or local felony for which he was ultimately convicted; or(5) committed a felony that is set forth in section 401 or 1010 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 841(j) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a sentence other than imprisonment in cases in which the defendant is a first offender who has not been convicted of a crime of violence or an otherwise serious offense, and the general appropriateness of imposing a term of imprisonment on a person convicted of a crime of violence that results in serious bodily injury.(k) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines reflect the inappropriateness of imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for the purpose of rehabilitating the defendant or providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.(l) The Commission shall insure that the guidelines promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(1) reflect\u2014(1) the appropriateness of imposing an incremental penalty for each offense in a case in which a defendant is convicted of\u2014(A) multiple offenses committed in the same course of conduct that result in the exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over one or more of the offenses; and(B) multiple offenses committed at different times, including those cases in which the subsequent offense is a violation of section 3146 (penalty for failure to appear) or is committed while the person is released pursuant to the provisions of section 3147 (penalty for an offense committed while on release) of title 18; and(2) the general inappropriateness of imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense of conspiring to commit an offense or soliciting commission of an offense and for an offense that was the sole object of the conspiracy or solicitation.(m) The Commission shall insure that th", "e guidelines reflect the fact that, in many cases, current sentences do not accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense. This will require that, as a starting point in its development of the initial sets of guidelines for particular categories of cases, the Commission ascertain the average sentences imposed in such categories of cases prior to the creation of the Commission, and in cases involving sentences to terms of imprisonment, the length of such terms actually served. The Commission shall not be bound by such average sentences, and shall independently develop a sentencing range that is consistent with the purposes of sentencing described in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18(n) The Commission shall assure that the guidelines reflect the general appropriateness of imposing a lower sentence than would otherwise be imposed, including a sentence that is lower than that established by statute as a minimum sentence, to take into account a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.(o) The Commission periodically shall review and revise, in consideration of comments and data coming to its attention, the guidelines promulgated pursuant to the provisions of this section. In fulfilling its duties and in exercising its powers, the Commission shall consult with authorities on, and individual and institutional representatives of, various aspects of the Federal criminal justice system. The United States Probation System, the Bureau of Prisons, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice, and a representative of the Federal Public Defenders shall submit to the Commission any observations, comments, or questions pertinent to the work of the Commission whenever they believe such communication would be useful, and shall, at least annually, submit to the Commission a written report commenting on the operation of the Commission\u2019s guidelines, suggesting changes in the guidelines that ap", "pear to be warranted, and otherwise assessing the Commission\u2019s work.(p) The Commission, at or after the beginning of a regular session of Congress, but not later than the first day of May, may promulgate under subsection (a) of this section and submit to Congress amendments to the guidelines and modifications to previously submitted amendments that have not taken effect, including modifications to the effective dates of such amendments. Such an amendment or modification shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons therefor and shall take effect on a date specified by the Commission, which shall be no earlier than 180 days after being so submitted and no later than the first day of November of the calendar year in which the amendment or modification is submitted, except to the extent that the effective date is revised or the amendment is otherwise modified or disapproved by Act of Congress.(q) The Commission and the Bureau of Prisons shall submit to Congress an analysis and recommendations concerning maximum utilization of resources to deal effectively with the Federal prison population. Such report shall be based upon consideration of a variety of alternatives, including\u2014(1) modernization of existing facilities;(2) inmate classification and periodic review of such classification for use in placing inmates in the least restrictive facility necessary to ensure adequate security; and(3) use of existing Federal facilities, such as those currently within military jurisdiction.(r) The Commission, not later than two years after the initial set of sentencing guidelines promulgated under subsection (a) goes into effect, and thereafter whenever it finds it advisable, shall recommend to the Congress that it raise or lower the grades, or otherwise modify the maximum penalties, of those offenses for which such an adjustment appears appropriate.(s) The Commission shall give due consideration to any petition filed by a defendant requesting modification of the guidelines utilized in the sentencing of such defendant, on the", " basis of changed circumstances unrelated to the defendant, including changes in\u2014(1) the community view of the gravity of the offense;(2) the public concern generated by the offense; and(3) the deterrent effect particular sentences may have on the commission of the offense by others.(t) The Commission, in promulgating general policy statements regarding the sentencing modification provisions in section 3582(c)(1)(A) of title 18(u) If the Commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses, it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.(v) The Commission shall ensure that the general policy statements promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)(2) include a policy limiting consecutive terms of imprisonment for an offense involving a violation of a general prohibition and for an offense involving a violation of a specific prohibition encompassed within the general prohibition.(w)(1) The Chief Judge of each district court shall ensure that, within 30 days following entry of judgment in every criminal case, the sentencing court submits to the Commission, in a format approved and required by the Commission, a written report of the sentence, the offense for which it is imposed, the age, race, sex of the offender, and information regarding factors made relevant by the guidelines. The report shall also include\u2014(A) the judgment and commitment order;(B) the written statement of reasons for the sentence imposed (which shall include the reason for any departure from the otherwise applicable guideline range and which shall be stated on the written statement of reasons form issued by the Judicial Conference and approved by the United States Sentencing Commission);(C) any plea agreement;(D) the indictment or other charging document;(E) the presentence report; and(F) any other information as the Commission finds appropriate.The information referred to in s", "ubparagraphs (A) through (F) shall be submitted by the sentencing court in a format approved and required by the Commission.(2) The Commission shall, upon request, make available to the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary, the written reports and all underlying records accompanying those reports described in this section, as well as other records received from courts.(3) The Commission shall submit to Congress at least annually an analysis of these documents, any recommendations for legislation that the Commission concludes is warranted by that analysis, and an accounting of those districts that the Commission believes have not submitted the appropriate information and documents required by this section.(4) The Commission shall make available to the Attorney General, upon request, such data files as the Commission itself may assemble or maintain in electronic form as a result of the information submitted under paragraph (1). Such data files shall be made available in electronic form and shall include all data fields requested, including the identity of the sentencing judge.(x) The provisions of section 553 of title 5(y) The Commission, in promulgating guidelines pursuant to subsection (a)(1), may include, as a component of a fine, the expected costs to the Government of any imprisonment, supervised release, or probation sentence that is ordered.(Added Pub.

Said section 341 provided that the Supreme Court should have original jurisdiction of controversies between a State and citizens of other States or aliens, whereas the 11th Amendment prohibits an action in any Federal Court against a State by citizens of another State or aliens.The original jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by Article 3, section 2, of the Constitution is not exclusive by virtue of that provision alone. Congress may provide for or deny exclusiveness. Ames v.

Lake Shore & M.S. Ry. CoAll the provisions with reference to removal of controversies between citizens of different States because of inability, from prejudice or local influence, to obtain justice, have been discarded. These provisions, born of the bitter sectional feelings engendered by the Civil War and the Reconstruction period, have no place in the jurisprudence of a nation since united by three wars against foreign powers. Indeed, the practice of removal for prejudice or local influence has not been employed much in recent years.Subsection (c) has been substituted for the provision in section 71 of title 28This quoted language has occasioned much confusion. The courts have attempted to distinguish between separate and separable controversies, a distinction which is sound in theory but illusory in substance. (See 41 Harv. L. Rev. 1048; 35 Ill. L. Rev. 576.)Subsection (c) permits the removal of a separate cause of action but not of a separable controversy unless it constitutes a separate and independent claim or cause of action within the original jurisdiction of United States District Courts. In this respect it will somewhat decrease the volume of Federal litigation.Rules 18, 20, and 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure permit the most liberal joinder of parties, claims, and remedies in civil actions. Therefore there will be no procedural difficulty occasioned by the removal of the entire action. Conversely, if the court so desires, it may remand to the State court all nonremovable matters.The provisions of section 71 of title 28section 20 of title 49section 1445 of this titleEditori", "al NotesAmendments2011\u2014Pub.

Procedure for removal of civil actions(a) GenerallyA defendant or defendants desiring to remove any civil action from a State court shall file in the district court of the United States for the district and division within which such action is pending a notice of removal signed pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal, together with a copy of all process, pleadings, and orders served upon such defendant or defendants in such action.(b) Requirements; Generally(1) The notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based, or within 30 days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant, whichever period is shorter.(2)(A) When a civil action is removed solely under section 1441(a), all defendants who have been properly joined and served must join in or consent to the removal of the action.(B) Each defendant shall have 30 days after receipt by or service on that defendant of the initial pleading or summons described in pa", "ragraph (1) to file the notice of removal.(C) If defendants are served at different times, and a later-served defendant files a notice of removal, any earlier-served defendant may consent to the removal even though that earlier-served defendant did not previously initiate or consent to removal.(3) Except as provided in subsection (c), if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable, a notice of removal may be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.(c) Requirements; Removal Based on Diversity of Citizenship(1) A case may not be removed under subsection (b)(3) on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by section 1332 more than 1 year after commencement of the action, unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has acted in bad faith in order to prevent a defendant from removing the action.(2) If removal of a civil action is sought on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a), the sum demanded in good faith in the initial pleading shall be deemed to be the amount in controversy, except that\u2014(A) the notice of removal may assert the amount in controversy if the initial pleading seeks\u2014(i) nonmonetary relief; or(ii) a money judgment, but the State practice either does not permit demand for a specific sum or permits recovery of damages in excess of the amount demanded; and(B) removal of the action is proper on the basis of an amount in controversy asserted under subparagraph (A) if the district court finds, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds the amount specified in section 1332(a).(3)(A) If the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable solely because the amount in controversy does not exceed the amount specified in section 1332(a), information relating to the amount in controversy in the record of the State proceeding, or in responses t", "o discovery, shall be treated as an \u201cother paper\u201d under subsection (b)(3).(B) If the notice of removal is filed more than 1 year after commencement of the action and the district court finds that the plaintiff deliberately failed to disclose the actual amount in controversy to prevent removal, that finding shall be deemed bad faith under paragraph (1).(d) Notice to Adverse Parties and State CourtPromptly after the filing of such notice of removal of a civil action the defendant or defendants shall give written notice thereof to all adverse parties and shall file a copy of the notice with the clerk of such State court, which shall effect the removal and the State court shall proceed no further unless and until the case is remanded.(e) Counterclaim in  ProceedingWith respect to any counterclaim removed to a district court pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the district court shall resolve such counterclaim in the same manner as an original complaint under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that the payment of a filing fee shall not be required in such cases and the counterclaim shall relate back to the date of the original complaint in the proceeding before the International Trade Commission under section 337 of that Act.(g)\u202f11(June 25, 1948, ch. 64662 Stat. 939May 24, 1949, ch. 139, \u00a7\u202f8363 Stat. 101Pub.

Words \u201cor final hearing\u201d following the words \u201cbefore trial,\u201d were omitted for purposes of clarity and simplification of procedure.The provision of said section 76 of title 28Subsection (d) is derived from sections 72 and 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., but the requirement for cost bond is limited to civil actions in conformity with the more enlightened trend of modern procedure to remove all unnecessary impediments to the administration of criminal justice. Provisions of said section 72 as to the conditions of the bond were rewritten because inappropriate when the petition for removal is filed in the Federal court.Subsection (e) provides for notice to the adverse parties and for the filing in the State court of a copy of the petition for removal in substitution for the requirements of sections 72 and 74 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed., for the filing of the removal petition in the State court. The last sentence of subsection (e) is derived from sections 72, 74 and 76 of t", "itle 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.Subsection (f) is derived from sections 75 and 76 of title 28, U.S.C., 1940 ed.Since the procedure in removal cases is now governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [Rule 81(c)] and Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [Rule 54(b)], the detailed directions of the various sections with respect to such procedure were omitted as unnecessary.Thus the provision of section 72 of title 28The provisions of section 74 of title 28section 1450 of this titleThe requirements of section 74 of title 28section 1447 of this titleThe provisions of section 74 of title 28section 1447(d) of this title1949 ActSubsection (b) of section 1446 of title 28The first paragraph of the amendment to subsection (b) corrects this situation by providing that the petition for removal need not be filed until 20 days after the defendant has received a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s initial pleading.This provision, however, without more, would create further difficulty in those States, such as Kentucky, where suit is commenced by the filing of the plaintiff\u2019s initial pleading and the issuance and service of a summons without any requirement that a copy of the pleading be served upon or otherwise furnished to the defendant. Accordingly the first paragraph of the amendment provides that in such cases the petition for removal shall be filed within 20 days after the service of the summons.The first paragraph of the amendment conforms to the amendment of rule 81(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, relating to removed actions, adopted by the Supreme Court on December 29, 1948The second paragraph of the amendment to subsection (b) is intended to make clear that the right of removal may be exercised at a later stage of the case if the initial pleading does not state a removable case but its removability is subsequently disclosed. This is declaratory of the existing rule laid down by the decisions. (See for example, Powers v. Chesapeake etc., Ry.

Procedure after removal generally(a) In any case removed from a State court, the district court may issue all necessary orders and process to bring before it all proper parties whether served by process issued by the State court or otherwise.(b) It may require the removing party to file with its clerk copies of all records and proceedings in such State court or may cause the same to be brought before it by writ of certiorari issued to such State court.(c) A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal. A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such case.(d) An order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise, except that an order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed pursuant to section 1442 or 1443 of this title shall be reviewable by appeal or otherwise.(e) If after removal the plaintiff seeks to join additional defendants whose joinder would destroy subject matter jurisdiction, the court may deny joinder, or permit joinder and remand the action to the State court.(June 25, 1948, ch.", " 64662 Stat. 939May 24, 1949, ch. 139, \u00a7\u202f8463 Stat. 102Pub.

For good cause shown, the United States district court may grant relief from the limitations of this paragraph.(3) The filing of a notice of removal of a criminal prosecution shall not prevent the State court in which such prosecution is pending from proceeding further, except that a judgment of conviction shall not be entered unless the prosecution is first remanded.(4) The United States district court in which such notice is filed shall examine the notice promptly. If it clearly appears on the face of the notice and any exhibits annexed thereto that removal should not be permitted, the court shall make an order for summary remand.(5) If the United States district court does not order the s", "ummary remand of such prosecution, it shall order an evidentiary hearing to be held promptly and, after such hearing, shall make such disposition of the prosecution as justice shall require.

Findings and declaration of purpose\nThe Congress finds that the determination by United States courts of the claims of foreign states to immunity from the jurisdiction of such courts would serve the interests of justice and would protect the rights of both foreign states and litigants in United States courts. Under international law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned, and their commercial property may be levied upon for the satisfaction of judgments rendered against them in connection with their commercial activities. Claims of foreign states to immunity should henceforth be decided by courts of the United States and of the States in conformity with the principles set forth in this chapter.(Added Pub.

The plan shall be placed into operation after approval by a reviewing panel consisting of the members of the judicial council of the circuit and either the chief judge of the district whose plan is being reviewed or such other active district judge of that district as the chief judge of the district may designate. The panel shall examine the plan to ascertain that it complies with the provisions of this title. If the reviewing panel finds that the plan does not comply, the panel shall state the particulars in which the plan fails to comply and direct the district court to present within a reasonable time an alternative plan remedying the defect or defects. Separate plans may be adopted for each division or combination of divisions within a judicial district. The district court may modify a plan at any time and it shall modify the plan when so directed by the reviewing panel. The district court shall promptly notify the panel, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, and the Attorney General of the United States, of the initial adoption and future modifications of the plan by filing copies therewith. Modifications of the plan made at the instance of the district court shall become effective after approval by the panel. Each district court shall submit a report on the jury selection process within its jurisdiction to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts in such form and at such times as the Judicial Conference of the United States may specify. The Judicial Conference of the Uni", "ted States may, from time to time, adopt rules and regulations governing the provisions and the operation of the plans formulated under this title.(b) Among other things, such plan shall\u2014(1) either establish a jury commission, or authorize the clerk of the court, to manage the jury selection process. If the plan establishes a jury commission, the district court shall appoint one citizen to serve with the clerk of the court as the jury commission: Provided, however(2) specify whether the names of prospective jurors shall be selected from the voter registration lists or the lists of actual voters of the political subdivisions within the district or division. The plan shall prescribe some other source or sources of names in addition to voter lists where necessary to foster the policy and protect the rights secured by sections 1861 and 1862 of this title. The plan for the District of Columbia may require the names of prospective jurors to be selected from the city directory rather than from voter lists. The plans for the districts of Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone may prescribe some other source or sources of names of prospective jurors in lieu of voter lists, the use of which shall be consistent with the policies declared and rights secured by sections 1861 and 1862 of this title. The plan for the district of Massachusetts may require the names of prospective jurors to be selected from the resident list provided for in chapter 234A, Massachusetts General Laws, or comparable authority, rather than from voter lists.(3) specify detailed procedures to be followed by the jury commission or clerk in selecting names from the sources specified in paragraph (2) of this subsection. These procedures shall be designed to ensure the random selection of a fair cross section of the persons residing in the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes. They shall ensure that names of persons residing in each of the counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions within the judicial district or division are ", "placed in a master jury wheel; and shall ensure that each county, parish, or similar political subdivision within the district or division is substantially proportionally represented in the master jury wheel for that judicial district, division, or combination of divisions. For the purposes of determining proportional representation in the master jury wheel, either the number of actual voters at the last general election in each county, parish, or similar political subdivision, or the number of registered voters if registration of voters is uniformly required throughout the district or division, may be used.(4) provide for a master jury wheel (or a device similar in purpose and function) into which the names of those randomly selected shall be placed. The plan shall fix a minimum number of names to be placed initially in the master jury wheel, which shall be at least one-half of 1 per centum of the total number of persons on the lists used as a source of names for the district or division; but if this number of names is believed to be cumbersome and unnecessary, the plan may fix a smaller number of names to be placed in the master wheel, but in no event less than one thousand. The chief judge of the district court, or such other district court judge as the plan may provide, may order additional names to be placed in the master jury wheel from time to time as necessary. The plan shall provide for periodic emptying and refilling of the master jury wheel at specified times, the interval for which shall not exceed four years.(5)(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), specify those groups of persons or occupational classes whose members shall, on individual request therefor, be excused from jury service. Such groups or classes shall be excused only if the district court finds, and the plan states, that jury service by such class or group would entail undue hardship or extreme inconvenience to the members thereof, and excuse of members thereof would not be inconsistent with sections 1861 and 1862 of this title.(B) ", "specify that volunteer safety personnel, upon individual request, shall be excused from jury service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term \u201cvolunteer safety personnel\u201d means individuals serving a public agency (as defined in section 1203(6) of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968\u202f11(6) specify that the following persons are barred from jury service on the ground that they are exempt: (A) members in active service in the Armed Forces of the United States; (B) members of the fire or police departments of any State, the District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United States, or any subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or such territory or possession; (C) public officers in the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the Government of the United States, or of any State, the District of Columbia, any territory or possession of the United States, or any subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or such territory or possession, who are actively engaged in the performance of official duties.(7) fix the time when the names drawn from the qualified jury wheel shall be disclosed to parties and to the public. If the plan permits these names to be made public, it may nevertheless permit the chief judge of the district court, or such other district court judge as the plan may provide, to keep these names confidential in any case where the interests of justice so require.(8) specify the procedures to be followed by the clerk or jury commission in assigning persons whose names have been drawn from the qualified jury wheel to grand and petit jury panels.(c) The initial plan shall be devised by each district court and transmitted to the reviewing panel specified in subsection (a) of this section within one hundred and twenty days of the date of enactment of the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968.

It is the marshal\u2019s duty to execute conveyances of property which he sells on execution and his salary compensates him therefor. There is no occasion for him to draw such a deed and no beneficial purpose in taxing the parties a fee for his signature.The 2 per centum fee for disbursing moneys is omitted as an unnecessary burden upon funds belonging to litigants.The provision that a folio consists of \u201c100 words or major fraction thereof\u201d is inserted to conform with section 607 of title 28The provision for a lump sum to be determined by the court and taxed in criminal cases was added. It fixes a maximum of $25 in misdemeanor cases and $100 in felony cases. It may be questioned whether costs as such should ever be taxed against the convicted defendant in a criminal case. The acquitted defendant is not permitted to tax costs against the United States. Indeed the allowance of costs in criminal cases is not a matter of right but rests com", "pletely within the discretion of the court. Morris v. United StatesIn Alberty v.

The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action;(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.(2) The time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.(June 25, 1948, ch. 64662 Stat. 965Pub.

State custody; remedies in Federal courts(a) The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court only on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.(b)(1) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that\u2014(A) the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State; or(B)(i) there is an absence of available State corrective process; or(ii) circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.(2) An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.(3) A State shall not be deemed to have waived the exhaustion requirement or be estopped from reliance upon the requirement unless the State, through counsel, expressly waives the requirement.(c) An applicant shall not be deemed to have exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, within the meaning of this section, if he has the right under the law of the State to raise, by any available procedure, the question presented.(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim\u2014(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary", " to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.(e)(1) In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.(2) If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless the applicant shows that\u2014(A) the claim relies on\u2014(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable; or(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been previously discovered through the exercise of due diligence; and(B) the facts underlying the claim would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense.(f) If the applicant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in such State court proceeding to support the State court\u2019s determination of a factual issue made therein, the applicant, if able, shall produce that part of the record pertinent to a determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to support such determination. If the applicant, because of indigency or other reason is unable to produce such part of the record, then the State shall produce such part of the record and the Federal court shall direct the State to do so by order directed to an appropriate State official. If the State cannot provide such pertinent part of the record, then the court shall determine under the existin", "g facts and circumstances what weight shall be given to the State court\u2019s factual determination.(g) A copy of the official records of the State court, duly certified by the clerk of such court to be a true and correct copy of a finding, judicial opinion, or other reliable written indicia showing such a factual determination by the State court shall be admissible in the Federal court proceeding.(h) Except as provided in section 408 of the Controlled Substances Act, in all proceedings brought under this section, and any subsequent proceedings on review, the court may appoint counsel for an applicant who is or becomes financially unable to afford counsel, except as provided by a rule promulgated by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority.

(See Ex parte Hawk, 1944, 64 S. Ct. 448, 321, U.S. 114, 88L. Ed. 572.)Senate Revision AmendmentsSenate amendment to this section, Senate Report No. 1559, amendment No. 47, has three declared purposes, set forth as follows:\u201cThe first is to eliminate from the prohibition of the section applications in behalf of prisoners in custody under authority of a State officer but whose custody has not been directed by the judgment of a State court. If the section were applied to applications by persons detained solely under authority of a State officer it would unduly hamper Federal courts in the protection of Federal officers prosecuted for acts committed in the course of official duty.\u201cThe second purpose is to eliminate, as a ground of Federal jurisdiction to revie", "w by habeas corpus judgments of State courts, the proposition that the State court has denied a prisoner a \u2018fair adjudication of the legality of his detention under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u2019 The Judicial Conference believes that this would be an undesirable ground for Federal jurisdiction in addition to exhaustion of State remedies or lack of adequate remedy in the State courts because it would permit proceedings in the Federal court on this ground before the petitioner had exhausted his State remedies. This ground would, of course, always be open to a petitioner to assert in the Federal court after he had exhausted his State remedies or if he had no adequate State remedy.\u201cThe third purpose is to substitute detailed and specific language for the phrase \u2018no adequate remedy available.\u2019 That phrase is not sufficiently specific and precise, and its meaning should, therefore, be spelled out in more detail in the section as is done by the amendment.\u201dEditorial Notes\nReferences in TextSection 408 of the Controlled Substances Act, referred to in subsec.

See Preiser v. Rodrigueze.gGlazier v. HackelHammond v. LenfestThe basic scope of habeas corpus is prescribed by statute. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2241(c) provides that the \u201cwrit of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless\u2000*\u2000*\u2000*\u2000(h)e is in custodyIn Preiser v. Rodriguez, supraInitially the Supreme Court held that habeas corpus was appropriate only in those situations in which petitioner\u2019s claim would, if upheld, result in an immediate release from a present custody. McNally v. HillPeyton v. RoweCarafas v. LaValleeSee also Preiser v. Rodri", "guezSince CarafasJones v. CunninghamHensley v. Municipal CourtLefkowitz v. NewsomeUnited States v. ReWalker v. North CarolinaBurris v. RyanMarden v. PurdyUnited States ex rel. Smith v. DibellaChoung v. CaliforniaUnited States ex rel. Meadows v. New YorkCapler v. City of GreenvilleGlover v. North CarolinaThe courts are not unanimous in dealing with the above situations, and the boundaries of custody remain somewhat unclear. In Morgan v. ThomasIt is axiomatic that actual physical custody or restraint is not required to confer habeas jurisdiction. Rather, the term is synonymous with restraint of liberty. The real question is how much restraint of one\u2019s liberty is necessary before the right to apply for the writ comes into play. *\u2000*\u2000*It is clear however, that something more than moral restraint is necessary to make a case for habeas corpus.321 F.Supp. at 573Hammond v. LenfestWhile the language of the Act indicates that a writ of habeas corpus is appropriate only when a petitioner is \u201cin custody,\u201d *\u2000*\u2000* the Act \u201cdoes not attempt to mark the boundaries of \u2018custody\u2019 nor in any way other than by use of that word attempt to limit the situations in which the writ can be used.\u201d *\u2000*\u2000* And, recent Supreme Court decisions have made clear that \u201c[i]t [habeas corpus] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose\u2014the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.\u201d *\u2000*\u2000* \u201c[B]esides physical imprisonment, there are other restraints on a man\u2019s liberty, restraints not shared by the public generally, which have been thought sufficient in the English-speaking world to support the issuance of habeas corpus.\u201d398 F.2d at 710\u2013711There is, as of now, no final list of the situations which are appropriate for habeas corpus relief. It is not the intent of these rules or notes to define or limit \u201ccustody.\u201dIt is, however, the view of the Advisory Committee that claims of improper conditions of custody or confine", "ment (not related to the propriety of the custody itself), can better be handled by other means such as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1983 and other related statutes. In Wilwording v. SwansonJohnson v. AveryThe distinction between duration of confinement and conditions of confinement may be difficult to draw. Compare Preiser v. RodriguezClutchette v.

The rule provides more specific guidance for a petitioner and the court than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2242, after which it is patterned.Subdivision (a) provides that an applicant challenging a state judgment, pursuant to which he is presently in custody, must make his application in the form of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. It also requires that the state officer having custody of the applicant be named as respondent. This is consistent with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2242, which says in part, \u201c[Application for a writ of habeas corpus] shall allege *\u2000*\u2000* th", "e name of the person who has custody over [the applicant] *\u2000*\u2000*.\u201d The proper person to be served in the usual case is either the warden of the institution in which the petitioner is incarcerated (Sanders v. BennettSubdivision (b) prescribes the procedure to be used for a petition challenging a judgment under which the petitioner will be subject to custody in the future. In this event the relief sought will usually not be released from present custody, but rather for a declaration that the judgment being attacked is invalid. Subdivision (b) thus provides for a prayer for \u201cappropriate relief.\u201d It is also provided that the attorney general of the state of the judgment as well as the state officer having actual custody of the petitioner shall be named as respondents. This is appropriate because no one will have custody of the petitioner in the state of the judgment being attacked, and the habeas corpus action will usually be defended by the attorney general. The attorney general is in the best position to inform the court as to who the proper party respondent is. If it is not the attorney general, he can move for a substitution of party.Since the concept of \u201ccustody\u201d requisite to the consideration of a petition for habeas corpus has been enlarged significantly in recent years, it may be worthwhile to spell out the various situations which might arise and who should be named as respondent(s) for each situation.(1) The applicant is in jail, prison, or other actual physical restraint due to the state action he is attacking. The named respondent shall be the state officer who has official custody of the petitioner (for example, the warden of the prison).(2) The applicant is on probation or parole due to the state judgment he is attacking. The named respondents shall be the particular probation or parole officer responsible for supervising the applicant, and the official in charge of the parole or probation agency, or the state correctional agency, as appropriate.(3) The applicant is in custody in any other manner differi", "ng from (1) and (2) above due to the effects of the state action he seeks relief from. The named respondent should be the attorney general of the state wherein such action was taken.(4) The applicant is in jail, prison, or other actual physical restraint but is attacking a state action which will cause him to be kept in custody in the future rather than the government action under which he is presently confined. The named respondents shall be the state or federal officer who has official custody of him at the time the petition is filed and the attorney general of the state whose action subjects the petitioner to future custody.(5) The applicant is in custody, although not physically restrained, and is attacking a state action which will result in his future custody rather than the government action out of which his present custody arises. The named respondent(s) shall be the attorney general of the state whose action subjects the petitioner to future custody, as well as the government officer who has present official custody of the petitioner if there is such an officer and his identity is ascertainable.In any of the above situations the judge may require or allow the petitioner to join an additional or different party as a respondent if to do so would serve the ends of justice.As seen in rule 1 and paragraphs (4) and (5) above, these rules contemplate that a petitioner currently in federal custody will be permitted to apply for habeas relief from a state restraint which is to go into effect in the future. There has been disagreement in the courts as to whether they have jurisdiction of the habeas application under these circumstances (compare Piper v. United StatesUnited States ex rel. Meadows v. New YorkSubdivision (c) provides that unless a district court requires otherwise by local rule, the petition must be in the form annexed to these rules. Having a standard prescribed form has several advantages. In the past, petitions have frequently contained mere conclusions of law, unsupported by any facts. Since it i", "s the relationship of the facts to the claim asserted that is important, these petitions were obviously deficient. In addition, lengthy and often illegible petitions, arranged in no logical order, were submitted to judges who have had to spend hours deciphering them. For example, in Passic v. MichiganAdministrative convenience, of benefit to both the court and the petitioner, results from the use of a prescribed form. Judge Hubert L. Will briefly described the experience with the use of a standard form in the Northern District of Illinois:Our own experience, though somewhat limited, has been quite satisfactory. *\u2000*\u2000*In addition, [petitions] almost always contain the necessary basic information *\u2000*\u2000*. Very rarely do we get the kind of hybrid federal-state habeas corpus petition with civil rights allegations thrown in which were not uncommon in the past. *\u2000*\u2000* [W]hen a real constitutional issue is raised it is quickly apparent *\u2000*\u2000*.33 F.R.D. 363, 384Approximately 65 to 70% of all districts have adopted forms or local rules which require answers to essentially the same questions as contained in the standard form annexed to these rules. All courts using forms have indicated the petitions are time-saving and more legible. The form is particularly helpful in getting information about whether there has been an exhaustion of state remedies or, at least, where that information can be obtained.The requirement of a standard form benefits the petitioner as well. His assertions are more readily apparent, and a meritorious claim is more likely to be properly raised and supported. The inclusion in the form of the ten most frequently raised grounds in habeas corpus petitions is intended to encourage the applicant to raise all his asserted grounds in one petition. It may better enable him to recognize if an issue he seeks to raise is cognizable under habeas corpus and hopefully inform him of those issues as to which he must first exhaust his state remedies.Some commentators have suggested that the use of forms is of little help ", "because the questions usually are too general, amounting to little more than a restatement of the statute. They contend the blanks permit a prisoner to fill in the same ambiguous answers he would have offered without the aid of a form. See Comment, Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1177\u20131178 (1970). Certainly, as long as the statute requires factual pleading, the adequacy of a petition will continue to be affected largely by the petitioner\u2019s intelligence and the legal advice available to him. On balance, however, the use of forms has contributed enough to warrant mandating their use.Giving the petitioner a list of often-raised grounds may, it is said, encourage perjury. See Comment, Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1178 (1970). Most inmates are aware of, or have access to, some common constitutional grounds for relief. Thus, the risk of perjury is not likely to be substantially increased and the benefit of the list for some inmates seems sufficient to outweigh any slight risk that perjury will increase. There is a penalty for perjury, and this would seem the most appropriate way to try to discourage it.Legal assistance is increasingly available to inmates either through paraprofessional programs involving law students or special programs staffed by members of the bar. See Jacob and Sharma, Justice After Trial: Prisoners\u2019 Need for Legal Services in the Criminal-Correctional Process, 18 Kan.L.Rev. 493 (1970). In these situations, the prescribed form can be filled out more competently, and it does serve to ensure a degree of uniformity in the manner in which habeas corpus claims are presented.Subdivision (c) directs the clerk of the district court to make available to applicants upon request, without charge, blank petitions in the prescribed form.Subdivision (c) also requires that all available grounds for relief be presented in the petition, including those grounds of which, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, the petitioner should be aware. ", "This is reinforced by rule 9(b), which allows dismissal of a second petition which fails to allege new grounds or, if new grounds are alleged, the judge finds an inexcusable failure to assert the ground in the prior petition.Both subdivision (c) and the annexed form require a legibly handwritten or typewritten petition. As required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2242, the petition must be signed and sworn to by the petitioner (or someone acting in his behalf).Subdivision (d) provides that a single petition may assert a claim only against the judgment or judgments of a single state court (i.eSubdivision (e) allows the clerk to return an insufficient petition to the petitioner, and it must be returned if the clerk is so directed by a judge of the court. Any failure to comply with the requirements of rule 2 or 3 is grounds for insufficiency. In situations where there may be arguable noncompliance with another rule, such as rule 9, the judge, not the clerk, must make the decision. If the petition is returned it must be accompanied by a statement of the reason for its return. No petitioner should be left to speculate as to why or in what manner his petition failed to conform to these rules.Subdivision (e) also provides that the clerk shall retain one copy of the insufficient petition. If the prisoner files another petition, the clerk will be in a better position to determine the sufficiency of the new petition. If the new petition is insufficient, comparison with the prior petition may indicate whether the prisoner has failed to understand the clerk\u2019s prior explanation for its insufficiency, so that the clerk can make another, hopefully successful, attempt at transmitting this information to the petitioner. If the petitioner insists that the original petition was in compliance with the rules, a copy of the original petition is available for the consideration of the judge. It is probably better practice to make a photocopy of a petition which can be corrected by the petitioner, thus saving the petitioner the task of completing an addi", "tional copy.1982 AmendmentSubdivision (c). The amendment takes into account 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1746, enacted after adoption of the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules. Section 1746 provides that in lieu of an affidavit an unsworn statement may be given under penalty of perjury in substantially the following form if executed within the United States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: \u201cI declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).\u201d The statute is \u201cintended to encompass prisoner litigation,\u201d and the statutory alternative is especially appropriate in such cases because a notary might not be readily available. Carter v. ClarkCommittee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.Revised Rule 2(c)(5) has been amended by removing the requirement that the petition be signed personally by the petitioner. As reflected in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2242, an application for habeas corpus relief may be filed by the person who is seeking relief, or by someone acting on behalf of that person. See, e.g., Whitmore v. ArkansasThe language in new Rule 2(d) has been changed to reflect that a petitioner must substantially follow the standard form, which is appended to the rules, or a form provided by the court. The current rule, Rule 2(c), seems to indicate a preference for the standard \u201cnational\u201d form. Under the amended rule, there is no stated preference. The Committee understood that current practice in some courts is that if the petitioner first files a petition using the national form, the courts may then ask the petitioner to supplement it with the local form.Current Rule 2(e), which provided for returning an insufficient petition, has been deleted. The Committee believed that the approach in Fed", "eral Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e) was more appropriate for dealing with petitions that do not conform to the form requirements of the rule. That Rule provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214seeChanges Made After Publication and CommentsRule 2(c)(4) was modified to account for those cases where the petitioner prints the petition on a computer word-processing program.Amendments by Public Law1976\u2014Subd.

Some of its provisions are currently dealt with by local rule or practice, while others are innovations. Subdivision (a) specifies the petitioner\u2019s responsibilities. It requires that the petition, which must be accompanied by two conformed copies thereof, be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court. The petition must be accompanied by the filing fee prescribed by law (presently $5; see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1914(a)), unless leave to prosecute the petition in forma pauperis is applied for and granted. In the event the petitioner desires to prosecute the petition in forma pauperis, he must file the affidavit required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1915, together with a certificate showing the amount of funds in his institutional account.Requiring that th", "e petition be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court provides an efficient and uniform system of filing habeas corpus petitions.Subdivision (b) requires the clerk to file the petition. If the filing fee accompanies the petition, it may be filed immediately, and, if not, it is contemplated that prompt attention will be given to the request to proceed in forma pauperis. The court may delegate the issuance of the order to the clerk in those cases in which it is clear from the petition that there is full compliance with the requirements to proceed in forma pauperis.Requiring the copies of the petition to be filed with the clerk will have an impact not only upon administrative matters, but upon more basic problems as well. In districts with more than one judge, a petitioner under present circumstances may send a petition to more than one judge. If no central filing system exists for each district, two judges may independently take different action on the same petition. Even if the action taken is consistent, there may be needless duplication of effort.The requirement of an additional two copies of the form of the petition is a current practice in many courts. An efficient filing system requires one copy for use by the court (central file), one for the respondent (under 3(b), the respondent receives a copy of the petition whether an answer is required or not), and one for petitioner\u2019s counsel, if appointed. Since rule 2 provides that blank copies of the petition in the prescribed form are to be furnished to the applicant free of charge, there should be no undue burden created by this requirement.Attached to copies of the petition supplied in accordance with rule 2 is an affidavit form for the use of petitioners desiring to proceed in forma pauperis. The form requires information concerning the petitioner\u2019s financial resources.In forma pauperis cases, the petition must also be accompanied by a certificate indicating the amount of funds in the petitioner\u2019s institution account. Usually the certificate will", " be from the warden. If the petitioner is on probation or parole, the court might want to require a certificate from the supervising officer. Petitions by persons on probation or parole are not numerous enough, however, to justify making special provision for this situation in the text of the rule.The certificate will verify the amount of funds credited to the petitioner in an institution account. The district court may by local rule require that any amount credited to the petitioner, in excess of a stated maximum, must be used for the payment of the filing fee. Since prosecuting an action in forma pauperis is a privilege (see Smart v. HeinzeSubdivision (b) details the clerk\u2019s duties with regard to filing the petition. If the petition does not appear on its face to comply with the requirements of rules 2 and 3, it may be returned in accordance with rule 2(e). If it appears to comply, it must be filed and entered on the docket in the clerk\u2019s office. However, under this subdivision the respondent is not required to answer or otherwise move with respect to the petition unless so ordered by the court.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 3 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended except as described below.The last sentence of current Rule 3(b), dealing with an answer being filed by the respondent, has been moved to revised Rule 5(a).Revised Rule 3(b) is new and is intended to parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e), which provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules.

Although the rule does not address the issue, every circuit that has addressed the issue has taken the position that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is available in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Smith v. McGinnisMiller v. New Jersey State Department of CorrectionsHarris v. HutchinsonSee Duncan v. WalkerRule 3(d) is new and provides guidance on determining whether a petition from an inmate is considered to have been filed in a timely fashion. The new provision parallels Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(C).Changes Made After Publication and CommentsRule 4. Preliminary Review; Serving the Petition and OrderThe clerk must promptly forward the petition to a judge under the court\u2019s assignment procedure, and the judge must promptly examine it. If it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court, the judge must dismiss the petition and direct the clerk to notify the petitioner. If the petition is not dismissed, the judge must order the respondent to file an answer, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take other action the judge may order. In every case, the clerk must serve a copy of the petition and any order on the respondent and on the attorney general or other appropriate officer of the state involved.(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Advisory Committee NoteRule 4 outlines the options available to the court after the petition is properly filed. The petition must be promptly presented to and examined by the judge to whom it is assigned. If it plainly appears from the face of the petition and any exhibits attached thereto that the petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court, the judge must enter an order summarily dismissing the petition and cause the petitioner to be notified. If summary dismissal is not ordered, the judge must order the", " respondent to file an answer or to otherwise plead to the petition within a time period to be fixed in the order.28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2243 requires that the writ shall be awarded, or an order to show cause issued, \u201cunless it appears from the application that the applicant or person detained is not entitled thereto.\u201d Such consideration may properly encompass any exhibits attached to the petition, including, but not limited to, transcripts, sentencing records, and copies of state court opinions. The judge may order any of these items for his consideration if they are not yet included with the petition. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f753(f) which authorizes payment for transcripts in habeas corpus cases.It has been suggested that an answer should be required in every habeas proceeding, taking into account the usual petitioner\u2019s lack of legal expertise and the important functions served by the return. See Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1178 (1970). However, under \u00a7\u202f2243 it is the duty of the court to screen out frivolous applications and eliminate the burden that would be placed on the respondent by ordering an unnecessary answer. Allen v. PeriniAubut v. State of MaineIn the event an answer is ordered under rule 4, the court is accorded greater flexibility than under \u00a7\u202f2243 in determining within what time period an answer must be made. Under \u00a7\u202f2243, the respondent must make a return within three days after being so ordered, with additional time of up to forty days allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 81(a)(2), for good cause. In view of the widespread state of work overload in prosecutors\u2019 offices (see, e.g., AllenRule 4 authorizes the judge to \u201ctake such other action as the judge deems appropriate.\u201d This is designed to afford the judge flexibility in a case where either dismissal or an order to answer may be inappropriate. For example, the judge may want to authorize the respondent to make a motion to dismiss based upon information furnished by respondent, which may show that petiti", "oner\u2019s claims have already been decided on the merits in a federal court; that petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies; that the petitioner is not in custody within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2254; or that a decision in the matter is pending in state court. In these situations, a dismissal may be called for on procedural grounds, which may avoid burdening the respondent with the necessity of filing an answer on the substantive merits of the petition. In other situations, the judge may want to consider a motion from respondent to make the petition more certain. Or the judge may want to dismiss some allegations in the petition, requiring the respondent to answer only those claims which appear to have some arguable merit.Rule 4 requires that a copy of the petition and any order be served by certified mail on the respondent and the attorney general of the state involved. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2252. Presently, the respondent often does not receive a copy of the petition unless the court directs an answer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2243. Although the attorney general is served, he is not required to answer if it is more appropriate for some other agency to do so. Although the rule does not specifically so provide, it is assumed that copies of the court orders to respondent will be mailed to petitioner by the court.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 4 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.The amended rule reflects that the response to a habeas petition may be a motion.The requirement that in every case the clerk must serve a copy of the petition on the respondent by certified mail has been deleted. In addition, the current requirement that the petition be sent to the Attorney General of the state has been modified to reflect practice in some jurisdictions that the appropriat", "e state official may be someone other than the Attorney General, for example, the officer in charge of a local confinement facility. This comports with a similar provision in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2252, which addresses notice of habeas corpus proceedings to the state\u2019s attorney general or other appropriate officer of the state.Changes Made After Publication and CommentsRule 5.

(This is a change in terminology from \u201creturn,\u201d which is still used below when referring to prior practice.) The answer plays an obviously important rule in a habeas proceeding:The return serves several important functions: it permits the court and the parties to uncover quickly the disputed issues; it may reveal to the petitioner\u2019s attorney grounds for release that the petitioner did not know; and it may demonstrate that the petitioner\u2019s claim is wholly without merit.Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1083, 1178 (1970).The answer must respond to the allegations of the petition. While some districts require this by local rule (see, e.gThe answer must also state whether the petitioner has exhausted his state remedies. This is a prerequisite to eligibility for the writ under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2254(b) and applies to every ground the petitioner raises. Most form petitions now in use contain questions requiring information relevant to whether the pe", "titioner has exhausted his remedies. However, the exhaustion requirement is often not understood by the unrepresented petitioner. The attorney general has both the legal expertise and access to the record and thus is in a much better position to inform the court on the matter of exhaustion of state remedies. An alleged failure to exhaust state remedies as to any ground in the petition may be raised by a motion by the attorney general, thus avoiding the necessity of a formal answer as to that ground.The rule requires the answer to indicate what transcripts are available, when they can be furnished, and also what proceedings have been recorded and not transcribed. This will serve to inform the court and petitioner as to what factual allegations can be checked against the actual transcripts. The transcripts include pretrial transcripts relating, for example, to pretrial motions to suppress; transcripts of the trial or guilty plea proceeding; and transcripts of any post-conviction proceedings which may have taken place. The respondent is required to furnish those portions of the transcripts which he believes relevant. The court may order the furnishing of additional portions of the transcripts upon the request of petitioner or upon the court\u2019s own motion.Where transcripts are unavailable, the rule provides that a narrative summary of the evidence may be submitted.Rule 5 (and the general procedure set up by this entire set of rules) does not contemplate a traverse to the answer, except under special circumstances. See advisory committee note to rule 9. Therefore, the old common law assumption of verity of the allegations of a return until impeached, as codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2248, is no longer applicable. The meaning of the section, with its exception to the assumption \u201cto the extent that the judge finds from the evidence that they (the allegations) are not true,\u201d has given attorneys and courts a great deal of difficulty. It seems that when the petition and return pose an issue of fact, no traverse is required; Stewa", "rt v. OverholserWe read \u00a7\u202f2248 of the Judicial Code as not requiring a traverse when a factual issue has been clearly framed by the petition and the return or answer. This section provides that the allegations of a return or answer to an order to show cause shall be accepted as true if not traversed, except to the extent the judge finds from the evidence that they are not true. This contemplates that where the petition and return or answer do present an issue of fact material to the legality of detention, evidence is required to resolve that issue despite the absence of a traverse. This reference to evidence assumes a hearing on issues raised by the allegations of the petition and the return or answer to the order to show cause.186 F.2d at 342, n. 5In actual practice, the traverse tends to be a mere pro forma refutation of the return, serving little if any expository function. In the interests of a more streamlined and manageable habeas corpus procedure, it is not required except in those instances where it will serve a truly useful purpose. Also, under rule 11 the court is given the discretion to incorporate Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when appropriate, so civil rule 15(a) may be used to allow the petitioner to amend his petition when the court feels this is called for by the contents of the answer.Rule 5 does not indicate who the answer is to be served upon, but it necessarily implies that it will be mailed to the petitioner (or to his attorney if he has one). The number of copies of the answer required is left to the court\u2019s discretion. Although the rule requires only a copy of petitioner\u2019s brief on appeal, respondent is free also to file a copy of respondent\u2019s brief. In practice, courts have found it helpful to have a copy of respondent\u2019s brief.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylist", "ic and no substantive change is intended, except as described below.Revised Rule 5(a), which provides that the respondent is not required to file an answer to the petition, unless a judge so orders, is taken from current Rule 3(b). The revised rule does not address the practice in some districts, where the respondent files a pre-answer motion to dismiss the petition. But revised Rule 4 permits that practice and reflects the view that if the court does not dismiss the petition, it may require (or permit) the respondent to file a motion.Rule 5(b) has been amended to require that the answer address not only failure to exhaust state remedies, but also procedural bars, non-retroactivity, and any statute of limitations. Although the latter three matters are not addressed in the current rule, the Committee intends no substantive change with the additional new language. See, e.g.See, e.g.Revised Rule 5(d) includes new material. First, Rule 5(d)(2), requires a respondent\u2014assuming an answer is filed\u2014to provide the court with a copy of any brief submitted by the prosecution to the appellate court. And Rule 5(d)(3) now provides that the respondent also file copies of any opinions and dispositive orders of the appellate court concerning the conviction or sentence. These provisions are intended to ensure that the court is provided with additional information that may assist it in resolving the issues raised, or not raised, in the petition.Finally, revised Rule 5(e) adopts the practice in some jurisdictions of giving the petitioner an opportunity to file a reply to the respondent\u2019s answer. Rather than using terms such as \u201ctraverse,\u201d seeChanges Made After Publication and CommentsThe Committee also deleted the reference to \u201caffirmative defenses,\u201d because the Committee believed that the term was a misnomer in the context of habeas petitions. The Note was also changed to reflect that there has been a potential substantive change from the current rule, to the extent that the published rule now requires that the answer address proced", "ural bars and any statute of limitations. The Note states that the Committee believes the new language reflects current law.The Note was modified to address the use of the term \u201ctraverse.\u201d One commentator noted that that is the term that is commonly used but that it does not appear in the rule itself.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142019 AmendmentThe petitioner has a right to file a reply. Subsection (e), added in 2004, removed the discretion of the court to determine whether or not to allow the petitioner to file a reply in a case under \u00a7\u202f2254. The current amendment was prompted by decisions holding that courts nevertheless retained the authority to bar a reply.As amended, the first sentence of subsection (e) makes it even clearer that the petitioner has a right to file a reply to the respondent\u2019s answer or pleading. It retains the word \u201cmay,\u201d which is used throughout the federal rules to mean \u201cis permitted to\u201d or \u201chas a right to.\u201d No change in meaning is intended by the substitution of \u201cfile\u201d for \u201csubmit.\u201dAs amended, the second sentence of the rule retains the court\u2019s discretion to decide when the reply must be filed (but not whether it may be filed). To avoid uncertainty, the amended rule requires the court to set a time for filing if that time is not already set by local rule. Adding a reference to the time for the filing of any reply to the order requiring the government to file an answer or other pleading provides notice of that deadline to both parties.Rule 6. Discovery(a) Leave of Court Required(b) Requesting Discovery(c) Deposition Expenses(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Advisory Committee NoteThis rule prescribes the procedures governing discovery in habeas corpus cases. Subdivision (a) provides that any party may utilize the processes of discovery available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (rules 26\u201337) if, and to the extent that, the judge allows. It also provides for the appointment of counsel for a petitioner who qualifies for this when counsel is necessary for effective utilization of discov", "ery procedures permitted by the judge.Subdivision (a) is consistent with Harris v. Nelson[I]t is clear that there was no intention to extend to habeas corpus, as a matter of right, the broad discovery provisions *\u2000*\u2000* of the new [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure].394 U.S. at 295However, citing the lack of methods for securing information in habeas proceedings, the court pointed to an alternative.Clearly, in these circumstances *\u2000*\u2000* the courts may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage. *\u2000*\u2000* Their authority is expressly confirmed in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1651.394 U.S. at 299The court concluded that the issue of discovery in habeas corpus cases could best be dealt with as part of an effort to provide general rules of practice for habeas corpus cases:In fact, it is our view that the rulemaking machinery should be invoked to formulate rules of practice with respect to federal habeas corpus and \u00a7\u202f2255 proceedings, on a comprehensive basis and not merely one confined to discovery. The problems presented by these proceedings are materially different from those dealt with in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and reliance upon usage and the opaque language of Civil Rule 81(a)(2) is transparently inadequate. In our view the results of a meticulous formulation and adoption of special rules for federal habeas corpus and \u00a7\u202f2255 proceedings would promise much benefit.394 U.S. at 301 n. 7Discovery may, in appropriate cases, aid in developing facts necessary to decide whether to order an evidentiary hearing or to grant the writ following an evidentiary hearing:We are aware that confinement sometimes induces fantasy which has its basis in the paranoia of prison rather than in fact. But where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is confined illegally and is therefore entitled to relief", ", it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry. Obviously, in exercising this power, the court may utilize familiar procedures, as appropriate, whether these are found in the civil or criminal rules or elsewhere in the \u201cusages and principles.\u201dGranting discovery is left to the discretion of the court, discretion to be exercised where there is a showing of good cause why discovery should be allowed. Several commentators have suggested that at least some discovery should be permitted without leave of court. It is argued that the courts will be burdened with weighing the propriety of requests to which the discovered party has no objection. Additionally, the availability of protective orders under Fed.R.Civ.R., Rules 30(b) and 31(d) will provide the necessary safeguards. See Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1186\u201387 (1970); Civil Discovery in Habeas Corpus, 67 Colum.L.Rev. 1296, 1310 (1967).Nonetheless, it is felt the requirement of prior court approval of all discovery is necessary to prevent abuse, so this requirement is specifically mandated in the rule.While requests for discovery in habeas proceedings normally follow the granting of an evidentiary hearing, there may be instances in which discovery would be appropriate beforehand. Such an approach was advocated in Wagner v. United Statesbefore or in conjunction with the hearingIn order to make pre-hearing discovery meaningful, subdivision (a) provides that the judge should appoint counsel for a petitioner who is without counsel and qualifies for appointment when this is necessary for the proper utilization of discovery procedures. Rule 8 provides for the appointment of counsel at the evidentiary hearing stage (see rule 8(b) and advisory committee note), but this would not assist the petitioner who seeks to utilize discovery to stave off dismissal of his petition (see rule 9 and advisory committee note) or to demonstrate that an evidentiary hearing is necessary. Thus, if the", " judge grants a petitioner\u2019s request for discovery prior to making a decision as to the necessity for an evidentiary hearing, he should determine whether counsel is necessary for the effective utilization of such discovery and, if so, appoint counsel for the petitioner if the petitioner qualifies for such appointment.This rule contains very little specificity as to what types and methods of discovery should be made available to the parties in a habeas proceeding, or how, once made available, these discovery procedures should be administered. The purpose of this rule is to get some experience in how discovery would work in actual practice by letting district court judges fashion their own rules in the context of individual cases. When the results of such experience are available it would be desirable to consider whether further, more specific codification should take place.Subdivision (b) provides for judicial consideration of all matters subject to discovery. A statement of the interrogatories, or requests for admission sought to be answered, and a list of any documents sought to be produced, must accompany a request for discovery. This is to advise the judge of the necessity for discovery and enable him to make certain that the inquiry is relevant and appropriately narrow.Subdivision (c) refers to the situation where the respondent is granted leave to take the deposition of the petitioner or any other person. In such a case the judge may direct the respondent to pay the expenses and fees of counsel for the petitioner to attend the taking of the deposition, as a condition granting the respondent such leave. While the judge is not required to impose this condition subdivision (c) will give the court the means to do so. Such a provision affords some protection to the indigent petitioner who may be prejudiced by his inability to have counsel, often court-appointed, present at the taking of a deposition. It is recognized that under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f3006A(g), court-appointed counsel in a \u00a7\u202f2254 proceeding is entitled to re", "ceive up to $250 and reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred. (Compare Fed.R. Crim.P. 15(c).) Typically, however, this does not adequately reimburse counsel if he must attend the taking of depositions or be involved in other pre-hearing proceedings. Subdivision (c) is intended to provide additional funds, if necessary, to be paid by the state government (respondent) to petitioner\u2019s counsel.Although the rule does not specifically so provide, it is assumed that a petitioner who qualifies for the appointment of counsel under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f3006A(g) and is granted leave to take a deposition will be allowed witness costs. This will include recording and transcription of the witness\u2019s statement. Such costs are payable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1825. See Opinion of Comptroller General, February 28, 1974Subdivision (c) specifically recognizes the right of the respondent to take the deposition of the petitioner. Although the petitioner could not be called to testify against his will in a criminal trial, it is felt the nature of the habeas proceeding, along with the safeguards accorded by the Fifth Amendment and the presence of counsel, justify this provision. See 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1183\u201384 (1970).Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 6 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.Although current Rule 6(b) contains no requirement that the parties provide reasons for the requested discovery, the revised rule does so and also includes a requirement that the request be accompanied by any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents. The Committee believes that the revised rule makes explicit what has been implicit in current practice.Changes Made After Publication and CommentsRule 7. Expanding the Record(a) In General(b) Types of Materials(c) Review by the ", "Opposing Party(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Advisory Committee NoteThis rule provides that the judge may direct that the record be expanded. The purpose is to enable the judge to dispose of some habeas petitions not dismissed on the pleadings, without the time and expense required for an evidentiary hearing. An expanded record may also be helpful when an evidentiary hearing is ordered.The record may be expanded to include additional material relevant to the merits of the petition. While most petitions are dismissed either summarily or after a response has been made, of those that remain, by far the majority require an evidentiary hearing. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970e.gAuthorizing expansion of the record will, hopefully, eliminate some unnecessary hearings. The value of this approach was articulated in Raines v. United StatesUnless it is clear from the pleadings and the files and records that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the statute makes a hearing mandatory. We think there is a permissible intermediate step that may avoid the necessity for an expensive and time consuming evidentiary hearing in every Section 2255 case. It may instead be perfectly appropriate, depending upon the nature of the allegations, for the district court to proceed by requiring that the record be expanded to include letters, documentary evidence, and, in an appropriate case, even affidavits. United States v. CarlinoMirra v. United StatesAccardi v. United StatesIn Harris v. NelsonAt any time in the proceedings *\u2000*\u2000* either on [the court\u2019s] own motionbeforeSubdivision (b) specifies the materials which may be added to the record. These include, without limitation, letters predating the filing of the petition in the district court, documents, exhibits, and answers under oath directed to written interrogatories propounded by the judge. Under this subdivision affidavits may be submitted and considered part of the record. Subdivision (b) is consistent with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u202f2246 and 2247 and the decision in RainesUnited Stat", "es v. CarlinoMachibroda v. United StatesUnder subdivision (c) all materials proposed to be included in the record must be submitted to the party against whom they are to be offered.Under subdivision (d) the judge can require authentication if he believes it desirable to do so.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 7 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as noted below.Revised Rule 7(a) is not intended to restrict the court\u2019s authority to expand the record through means other than requiring the parties themselves to provide the information. Further, the rule has been changed to remove the reference to the \u201cmerits\u201d of the petition in the recognition that a court may wish to expand the record in order to assist it in deciding an issue other than the merits of the petition.The language in current Rule 7(d), which deals with authentication of materials in the expanded record, has been moved to revised Rule 7(a).Changes Made After Publication and CommentsRule 8. Evidentiary Hearing(a) Determining Whether to Hold a Hearing(b) Reference to a Magistrate Judge(c) Appointing Counsel; Time of Hearing(As amended Pub. L. 94\u2013426, \u00a7\u202f2(5)Sept. 28, 197690 Stat. 1334Pub.

This determination is to be made upon a review of the answer, the transcript and record of state court proceedings, and if there is one, the expanded record. As the United States Supreme Court noted in Townsend v. SamOrdinarily [the complete state-court] record\u2014including the transcript of testimony (or if unavailable some adequate substitute, such as a narrative record), the pleadings, court opinions, and other pertinent documents\u2014is indispensable to determining whether the habeas applicant received a full and fair state-court evidentiary hearing resulting in reliable findings.Subdivision (a) contemplates that all of these materials, if available, will be taken into account. This is especially important in view of the standard set down in TownsendwhenThe appropriate standard *\u2000*\u2000* is this: Where the facts are in dispute, the federal court in habeas corpus must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas applicant did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in a state court, either at the time of the trial or in a collateral proceeding.372 U.S. at 312The circumstances under which a federal hearing is mandatory are now specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2254(d). The 1966 amendment clearly places the burden on the petitioner, when there has already been a state hearing, to show that it was not a fair or adequate hearing for one or more of the specifically enumerated reasons, in order to force a federal evidentiary hearing. Since the function of an evidentiary hearing is to try issues of fact (372 U.S. at 309), such a hearing is unnecessary when only issues of law are raised. See, e.g., Yeaman v. United StatesIn situations in which an evidentiary hearing is not mandatory, the judge may nonetheless decide that an evidentiary hearing is desirable:The purpose of the test is to indicate the situations in which the holding of an evidentiary hearing is mandatory. In all other cases where the material facts are in dispute, the holding of such a hearing is in ", "the discretion of the district judge.372 U.S. at 318If the judge decides that an evidentiary hearing is neither required nor desirable, he shall make such a disposition of the petition \u201cas justice shall require.\u201d Most habeas petitions are dismissed before the prehearing conference stage (see Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report 245a\u2013245c (table C4) (1970)) and of those not dismissed, the majority raise factual issues that necessitate an evidentiary hearing. If no hearing is required, most petitions are dismissed, but in unusual cases the court may grant the relief sought without a hearing. This includes immediate release from custody or nullification of a judgment under which the sentence is to be served in the future.Subdivision (b) provides that a magistrate, when so empowered by rule of the district court, may recommend to the district judge that an evidentiary hearing be held or that the petition be dismissed, provided he gives the district judge a sufficiently detailed description of the facts so that the judge may decide whether or not to hold an evidentiary hearing. This provision is not inconsistent with the holding in Wingo v. WeddingAs noted in WingoUtilization of the magistrate as specified in subdivision (b) will aid in the expeditious and fair handling of habeas petitions.A qualified, experienced magistrate will, it is hoped, acquire an expertise in examining these [postconviction review] applications and summarizing their important contents for the district judge, thereby facilitating his decisions. Law clerks are presently charged with this responsibility by many judges, but judges have noted that the normal 1-year clerkship does not afford law clerks the time or experience necessary to attain real efficiency in handling such applications.S. Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1967)Under subdivision (c) there are two provisions that differ from the procedure set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2243. These are the appointment of counsel and standard for determin", "ing how soon the hearing will be held.If an evidentiary hearing is required the judge must appoint counsel for a petitioner who qualified for appointment under the Criminal Justice Act. Currently, the appointment of counsel is not recognized as a right at any stage of a habeas proceeding. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Marshall v. Wilkinse.gCounsel can perform a valuable function benefiting both the court and the petitioner. The issues raised can be more clearly identified if both sides have the benefit of trained legal personnel. The presence of counsel at the prehearing conference may help to expedite the evidentiary hearing or make it unnecessary, and counsel will be able to make better use of available prehearing discovery procedures. Compare ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7\u202f4.4, p. 66 (Approved Draft 1968). At a hearing, the petitioner\u2019s claims are more likely to be effectively and properly presented by counsel.Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f3006A(g), payment is allowed counsel up to $250, plus reimbursement for expenses reasonably incurred. The standards of indigency under this section are less strict than those regarding eligibility to prosecute a petition in forma pauperis, and thus many who cannot qualify to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1915 will be entitled to the benefits of counsel under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f3006A(g). Under rule 6(c), the court may order the respondent to reimburse counsel from state funds for fees and expenses incurred as the result of the utilization of discovery procedures by the respondent.Subdivision (c) provides that the hearing shall be conducted as promptly as possible, taking into account \u201cthe need of counsel for both parties for adequate time for investigation and preparation.\u201d This differs from the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2243, which requires that the day for the hearing be set \u201cnot more than five days after the return unless for good cause additional time is allowed.\u201d This time limit fails to take into account the function that may b", "e served by a prehearing conference and the time required to prepare adequately for an evidentiary hearing. Although \u201cadditional time\u201d is often allowed under \u00a7\u202f2243, subdivision (c) provides more flexibility to take account of the complexity of the case, the availability of important materials, the workload of the attorney general, and the time required by appointed counsel to prepare.While the rule does not make specific provision for a prehearing conference, the omission is not intended to cast doubt upon the value of such a conference:The conference may limit the questions to be resolved, identify areas of agreement and dispute, and explore evidentiary problems that may be expected to arise. *\u2000*\u2000* [S]uch conferences may also disclose that a hearing is unnecessary *\u2000*\u2000*.ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7\u202f4.6, commentary pp. 74\u201375. (Approved Draft, 1968.)See also Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1188 (1970).The rule does not contain a specific provision on the subpoenaing of witnesses. It is left to local practice to determine the method for doing this. The implementation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1825 on the payment of witness fees is dealt with in an opinion of the Comptroller General, February 28, 1974Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 8 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.

Subdivision (a) deals with the delayed petition. Subdivision (b) deals with the second or successive petition.Subdivision (a) provides that a petition attacking the judgment of a state court may be dismissed on the grounds of delay if the petitioner knew or should have known of the existence of the grounds he is presently asserting in the petition and the delay has resulted in the state being prejudiced in its ability to respond to the petition. If the delay is more than five years after the judgment of conviction, prejudice is presumed, although this presumption is rebuttable by the petitioner. Otherwise, the state has the burden of showing such prejudice.The assertion of stale claims is a problem which is not likely to decrease in frequency. Following the decisions in Jones v. CunninghamBenso", "n v. CaliforniaThe interest of both the petitioner and the government can best be served if claims are raised while the evidence is still fresh. The American Bar Association has recognized the interest of the state in protecting itself against stale claims by limiting the right to raise such claims after completion of service of a sentence imposed pursuant to a challenged judgment. See ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7\u202f2.4 (c), p. 45 (Approved Draft, 1968). Subdivision (a) is not limited to those who have completed their sentence. Its reach is broader, extending to all instances where delay by the petitioner has prejudiced the state, subject to the qualifications and conditions contained in the subdivision.In McMann v. RichardsonWhat is at stake in this phase of the case is not the integrity of the state convictions obtained on guilty pleas, but whether, years later397 U.S. at 773The court refused to allow this, intimating its dislike of collateral attacks on sentences long since imposed which disrupt the state\u2019s interest in finality of convictions which were constitutionally valid when obtained.Subdivision (a) is not a statute of limitations. Rather, the limitation is based on the equitable doctrine of laches. \u201cLaches is such delay in enforcing one\u2019s rights as works disadvantage to another.\u201d 30A C.J.S. Equity \u00a7\u202f112, p. 19. Also, the language of the subdivision, \u201ca petition mayThe use of a flexible rule analogous to laches to bar the assertion of stale claims is suggested in ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7\u202f2.4, commentary at 48 (Approved Draft, 1968). Additionally, in Fay v. NoiaFurthermore, habeas corpus has traditionally been regarded as governed by equitable principles. United States ex rel. Smith v. Baldi372 U.S. at 438Finally, the doctrine of laches has been applied with reference to another postconviction remedy, the writ of coram nobis. See 24 C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7\u202f1606(25), p. 779.The standard used for determining if the petitioner shall be barred from asserting his", " claim is consistent with that used in laches provisions generally. The petitioner is held to a standard of reasonable diligence. Any inference or presumption arising by reason of the failure to attack collaterally a conviction may be disregarded where (1) there has been a change of law or fact (new evidence) or (2) where the court, in the interest of justice, feels that the collateral attack should be entertained and the prisoner makes a proper showing as to why he has not asserted a particular ground for relief.Subdivision (a) establishes the presumption that the passage of more than five years from the time of the judgment of conviction to the time of filing a habeas petition is prejudicial to the state. \u201cPresumption\u201d has the meaning given it by Fed.R.Evid. 301. The prisoner has \u201cthe burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption\u201d that the state has not been prejudiced by the passage of a substantial period of time. This does not impose too heavy a burden on the petitioner. He usually knows what persons are important to the issue of whether the state has been prejudiced. Rule 6 can be used by the court to allow petitioner liberal discovery to learn whether witnesses have died or whether other circumstances prejudicial to the state have occurred. Even if the petitioner should fail to overcome the presumption of prejudice to the state, he is not automatically barred from asserting his claim. As discussed previously, he may proceed if he neither knew nor, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, could have known of the grounds for relief.The presumption of prejudice does not come into play if the time lag is not more than five years.The time limitation should have a positive effect in encouraging petitioners who have knowledge of it to assert all their claims as soon after conviction as possible. The implementation of this rule can be substantially furthered by the development of greater legal resources for prisoners. See ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7\u202f3.1, pp. 49\u201350 ", "(Approved Draft, 1968).Subdivision (a) does not constitute an abridgement or modification of a substantive right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2072. There are safeguards for the hardship case. The rule provides a flexible standard for determining when a petition will be barred.Subdivision (b) deals with the problem of successive habeas petitions. It provides that the judge may dismiss a second or successive petition (1) if it fails to allege new or different grounds for relief or (2) if new or different grounds for relief are alleged and the judge finds the failure of the petitioner to assert those grounds in a prior petition is inexcusable.In Sanders v. United StatesControlling weight may373 U.S. at 15The requirement is that the prior determination of the same ground has been on the merits. This requirement is in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2244(b) and has been reiterated in many cases since SandersGains v. AllgoodHutchinson v. CravenBrown v. PeytonWith reference to a successive application asserting a new ground or one not previously decided on the merits, the court in SandersIn either case, full consideration of the merits of the new application can be avoided only if there has been an abuse of the writ *\u2000*\u2000* and this the Government has the burden of pleading. *\u2000*\u2000*Thus, for example, if a prisoner deliberately withholds one of two grounds for federal collateral relief at the time of filing his first application, *\u2000*\u2000* he may be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on a second application presenting the withheld ground.373 U.S. at 17\u201318Subdivision (b) has incorporated this principle and requires that the judge find petitioner\u2019s failure to have asserted the new grounds in the prior petition to be inexcusable.SandersThe burden is on the government to plead abuse of the writ. See Sanders v. United StatesDixon v. JacobsJohnson v. CopingerPrice v. Johnston[I]f the Government chooses *\u2000*\u2000* to claim that the prisoner has abused the writ of habeas corpusSubdivision (b) is consistent with the important and well established purpose of habea", "s corpus. It does not eliminate a remedy to which the petitioner is rightfully entitled. However, in SandersNothing in the traditions of habeas corpus requires the federal courts to tolerate needless piecemeal litigation, or to entertain collateral proceedings whose only purpose is to vex, harass, or delay.373 U.S. at 18There are instances in which petitioner\u2019s failure to assert a ground in a prior petition is excusable. A retroactive change in the law and newly discovered evidence are examples. In rare instances, the court may feel a need to entertain a petition alleging grounds that have already been decided on the merits. SandersThe form petition, supplied in accordance with rule 2(c), encourages the petitioner to raise all of his available grounds in one petition. It sets out the most common grounds asserted so that these may be brought to his attention.Some commentators contend that the problem of abuse of the writ of habeas corpus is greatly overstated:Most prisoners, of course, are interested in being released as soon as possible; only rarely will one inexcusably neglect to raise all available issues in his first federal application. The purpose of the \u201cabuse\u201d bar is apparently to deter repetitious applications from those few bored or vindictive prisoners *\u2000*\u2000*.83 Harv.L.Rev. at 1153\u20131154See also ABA Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7\u202f6.2, commentary at 92 (Approved Draft, 1968), which states: \u201cThe occasional, highly litigious prisoner stands out as the rarest exception.\u201d While no recent systematic study of repetitious applications exists, there is no reason to believe that the problem has decreased in significance in relation to the total number of \u00a7\u202f2254 petitions filed. That number has increased from 584 in 1949 to 12,088 in 1971. See Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Annual Report, table 16 (1971). It is appropriate that action be taken by rule to allow the courts to deal with this problem, whatever its specific magnitude. The bar set up by subdivision (b)", " is not one of rigid application, but rather is within the discretion of the courts on a case-by-case basis.If it appears to the court after examining the petition and answer (where appropriate) that there is a high probability that the petition will be barred under either subdivision of rule 9, the court ought to afford petitioner an opportunity to explain his apparent abuse. One way of doing this is by the use of the form annexed hereto. The use of a form will ensure a full airing of the issue so that the court is in a better position to decide whether the petition should be barred. This conforms with Johnson v. Copinger[T]he petitioner is obligated to present facts demonstrating that his earlier failure to raise his claims is excusable and does not amount to an abuse of the writ. However, it is inherent in this obligation placed upon the petitioner that he must be given an opportunity to make his explanation, if he has one. If he is not afforded such an opportunity, the requirement that he satisfy the court that he has not abused the writ is meaningless. Nor do we think that a procedure which allows the imposition of a forfeiture for abuse of the writ, without allowing the petitioner an opportunity to be heard on the issue, comports with the minimum requirements of fairness.420 F.2d at 399Use of the recommended form will contribute to an orderly handling of habeas petitions and will contribute to the ability of the court to distinguish the excusable from the inexcusable delay or failure to assert a ground for relief in a prior petition.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 9 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as noted below.First, current Rule 9(a) has been deleted as unnecessary in light of the applicable one-year statute of limitations for \u00a7\u202f2254 petitions, added as part of ", "the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2244(d).Second, current Rule 9(b), now Rule 9, has been changed to also reflect provisions in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2244(b)(3) and (4), which now require a petitioner to obtain approval from the appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive petition.Finally, the title of Rule 9 has been changed to reflect the fact that the only topic now addressed in the rules is that of second or successive petitions.Changes Made After Publication and CommentsAmendments by Public Law1976\u2014Subd.

However, when such duties involve the making of an order under rule 4 disposing of the petition, that order must be made by the court. The magistrate in such instances must submit to the court his report as to the facts and his recommendation with respect to the order.The Federal Magistrates Act allows magistrates, when empowered by local rule, to perform certain functions in proceedings for post-trial relief. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f636(b)(3). The performance of such functions, when authorized, is intended to \u201cafford some degree of relief to district judges and their law clerks, who are presently burdened with burgeoning numbers of habeas corpus petitions and applications under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255.\u201d Committee on the Judiciary, The Federal Magistrates Act, S.Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st sess., 26 (1967).Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f636(b), any district court,by the concurre", "nce of a majority of all the judges of such district court, may establish rules pursuant to which any full-time United States magistrate *\u2000*\u2000* may be assigned within the territorial jurisdiction of such court such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.The proposed rule recognizes the limitations imposed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f636(b) upon the powers of magistrates to act in federal postconviction proceedings. These limitations are: (1) that the magistrate may act only pursuant to a rule passed by the majority of the judges in the district court in which the magistrate serves, and (2) that the duties performed by the magistrate pursuant to such rule be consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.It has been suggested that magistrates be empowered by law to hold hearings and make final decisions in habeas proceedings. See Proposed Reformation of Federal Habeas Corpus Procedure: Use of Federal Magistrates, 54 Iowa L.Rev. 1147, 1158 (1969). However, the Federal Magistrates Act does not authorize such use of magistrates. Wingo v. WeddingWhere a full-time magistrate is not available, the duties contemplated by this rule may be assigned to a part-time magistrate.1979 AmendmentThis amendment conforms the rule to subsequently enacted legislation clarifying and further defining the duties which may be assigned to a magistrate, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f636, as amended in 1976 by Pub. L. 94\u2013577The reference to particular rules is stricken, as under \u00a7\u202f636(b)(1)(A) a judge may designate a magistrate to perform duties under other rules as well (e.g., order that further transcripts be furnished under rule 5; appoint counsel under rule 8). The reference to \u201cestablished standards and criteria\u201d is stricken, as \u00a7\u202f636(4) requires each district court to \u201cestablish rules pursuant to which the magistrates shall discharge their duties.\u201d The exception with respect to a rule 4 order dismissing a petition is stricken, as that limitation appears in \u00a7\u202f636(b)(1)(B) and is thereby applicable ", "to certain other actions under these rules as well (e.g., determination of a need for an evidentiary hearing under rule 8; dismissal of a delayed or successive petition under rule 9).Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 10 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.

Otherwise, those proceedings were to be considered outside of the scope of the rules without prejudice, of course, to the use of particular rules by analogy or otherwise, where appropriate.394 U.S. at 294The court then reiterated its commitment to judicial discretion in formulating rules and procedures for habeas corpus proceedings by stating:[T]he habeas corpus jurisdiction and the duty to exercise it being present, the courts may fashion appropriate modes of procedure, by analogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage.Where their duties require it, this is the inescapable obligation of the courts. Their authority is expressly confirmed in the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1651.394 U.S. at 299Rule 6 of these proposed rules deals specifically with the issue of discovery in habeas actions in a manner consistent with HarrisRule 11 permits application of th", "e civil rules only when it would be appropriate to do so.

If the court finds that the judgment was rendered without jurisdiction, or that the sentence imposed was not authorized by law or otherwise open to collateral attack, or that there has been such a denial or infringement of the constitutional rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment vulnerable to collateral attack, the court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.(c) A court may entertain and determine such motion without requiring the production of the prisoner at the hearing.(d) An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order entered on the motion as from a final judgment on application for a writ of habeas corpus.(e) An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective t", "o test the legality of his detention.(f) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.

ScopeThese rules govern a motion filed in a United States district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255 by:(a) a person in custody under a judgment of that court who seeks a determination that:(1) the judgment violates the Constitution or laws of the United States;(2) the court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment;(3) the sentence exceeded the maximum allowed by law; or(4) the judgment or sentence is otherwise subject to collateral review; and(b) a person in custody under a judgment of a state court or another federal court, and subject to future custody under a judgment of the district court, who seeks a determination that:(1) future custody under a judgment of the district court would violate the Constitution or laws of the United States;(2) the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment;(3) the district court\u2019s sentence exceeded the maximum allowed by law; or(4) the district court\u2019s judgment or sentence is otherwise subject to collateral review.(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Advisory Committee NoteThe basic scope of this postconviction remedy is prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255. Under these rules the person seeking relief from federal custody files a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, rather than a petition for habeas corpus. This is consistent with the terminology used in section 2255 and indicates the difference between this remedy and federal habeas for a state prisoner. Also, habeas corpus is available to the person in federal custody if his \u201cremedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201dWhereas sections 2241\u20132254 (dealing with federal habeas corpus for those in state custody) speak of the district court judge \u201cissuing the writ\u201d as the operative remedy, section 2255 provides that, if the judge finds the movant\u2019s assertions to be meritorious, he \u201cshall discharge the prisoner or resentence him or grant a new trial or correct the sentence as may appear appropriate.\u201d This is possible because a motion unde", "r \u00a7\u202f2255 is a further step in the movant\u2019s criminal case and not a separate civil action, as appears from the legislative history of section 2 of S. 20, 80th Congress, the provisions of which were incorporated by the same Congress in title 28 U.S.C. as \u00a7\u202f2255. In reporting S. 20 favorably the Senate Judiciary Committee said (Sen. Rep. 1526, 80th Cong. 2d Sess., p. 2):The two main advantages of such motion remedy over the present habeas corpus are as follows:First, habeas corpus is a separate civil action and not a further step in the criminal case in which petitioner is sentenced (Ex parte Tom TongMedleyThe fact that a motion under \u00a7\u202f2255 is a further step in the movant\u2019s criminal case rather than a separate civil action has significance at several points in these rules. See, e.gnotThe challenge of decisions such as the revocation of probation or parole are not appropriately dealt with under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255, which is a continuation of the original criminal action. Other remedies, such as habeas corpus, are available in such situations.Although rule 1 indicates that these rules apply to a motion for a determination that the judgment was imposed \u201cin violation of the .\u2000.\u2000. laws of the United States,\u201d the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255, it is not the intent of these rules to define or limit what is encompassed within that phrase. See Davis v. United StatesFor a discussion of the \u201ccustody\u201d requirement and the intended limited scope of this remedy, see advisory committee note to \u00a7\u202f2254 rule 1.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 1 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules.

Therefore, there is no requirement that the movant name a respondent. This is consistent with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255. The United States Attorney for the district in which the judgment under attack was entered is the proper party to oppose the motion since the federal government is the movant\u2019s adversary of record.If the movant is attacking a federal judgment which will subject him to future custody, he must be in present custody (see rule 1 and advisory committee note) as the result of a state or federal governmental action. He need not alter the nature of the motion by trying to include the government officer who presently has official custody of him as a psuedo-respondent, or third-party plaintiff, or other fabrication. The court hearing his motion attacking the future custody can exercise jurisdiction over those having him in present custody without the use of artificial pleading devices.There is presently a split among the courts as to whether a person currently in state custody may use a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion to obtain relief from a federal judgment under which he will be subjected to custody in the future.

United StatesUnder rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the court may correct an illegal sentence or a sentence imposed in an illegal manner, or may reduce the sentence. This remedy should be used, rather than a motion under these \u00a7\u202f2255 rules, whenever applicable, but there is some overlap between the two proceedings which has caused", " the courts difficulty.The movant should not be barred from an appropriate remedy because he has misstyled his motion. See United States v. MorganHeflin v. United StatesUnited States v. CokeHawkins v. United StatesMoss v. United StatesJones v. United StatesUnited States v. BrownOne area of difference between \u00a7\u202f2255 and rule 35 motions is that for the latter there is no requirement that the movant be \u201cin custody.\u201d Heflin v. United StatesDuggins v. United StatesPeyton v. RoweA rule 35 motion is used to attack the sentence imposed, not the basis for the sentence. The court in Gilinsky v. United StatesUnited States v. SemetAs regards Defendant\u2019s Motion under Rule 35, said Motion must be denied as its presupposes a valid conviction of the offense with which he was charged and may be used only to attack the sentence. It may not be used to examine errors occurring prior to the imposition of sentence.295 F.Supp. at 1085See also: Moss v. United StatesDuggins v. United StatesMigdal v. United StatesJones v. United StatesUnited States v. CokeUnited States v. BrownA major difficulty in deciding whether rule 35 or \u00a7\u202f2255 is the proper remedy is the uncertainty as to what is meant by an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d The Supreme Court dealt with this issue in Hill v. United States[T]he narrow function of Rule 35 is to permit correction at any time of an illegal sentence368 U.S. at 430The four dissenters felt the majority definition of \u201cillegal\u201d was too narrow.[Rule 35] provides for the correction of an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d without regard to the reasons why that sentence is illegal and contains not a single word to support the Court\u2019s conclusion that only a sentence illegal by reason of the punishment it imposes is \u201cillegal\u201d within the meaning of the Rule. I would have thought that a sentence imposed in an illegal manner\u2014whether the amount or form of the punishment meted out constitutes an additional violation of law or not\u2014would be recognized as an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d under any normal reading of the English language.368 U.S. at 431\u2013432The 19", "66 amendment of rule 35 added language permitting correction of a sentence imposed in an \u201cillegal manner.\u201d However, there is a 120-day time limit on a motion to do this, and the added language does not clarify the intent of the rule or its relation to \u00a7\u202f2255.The courts have been flexible in considering motions under circumstances in which relief might appear to be precluded by Hill v. United StatesPeterson v. United StatesThe courts have made even greater use of \u00a7\u202f2255 in these types of situations. In United States v. LewisHill v. United StatesIn United States v. McCarthyThe court in United States v. MalcolmThe flexible approach taken by the courts in the above cases seems to be the reasonable way to handle these situations in which rule 35 and \u00a7\u202f2255 appear to overlap. For a further discussion of this problem, see C. Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure; Criminal \u00a7\u00a7\u202f581\u2013587 (1969, Supp. 1975).See the advisory committee note to rule 2 of the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules for further discussion of the purposes and intent of rule 2 of these \u00a7\u202f2255 rules.1982 AmendmentSubdivision (b). The amendment takes into account 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1746, enacted after adoption of the \u00a7\u202f2255 rules. Section 1746 provides that in lieu of an affidavit an unsworn statement may be given under penalty of perjury in substantially the following form if executed within the United States, its territories, possessions or commonwealths: \u201cI declare (or certify, verify, or state) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date). (Signature).\u201d The statute is \u201cintended to encompass prisoner litigation,\u201d and the statutory alternative is especially appropriate in such cases because a notary might not be readily available. Carter v. ClarkCommittee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 2 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intende", "d, except as described below.Revised Rule 2(b)(5) has been amended by removing the requirement that the motion be signed personally by the moving party. Thus, under the amended rule the motion may be signed by [the] movant personally or by someone acting on behalf of the movant, assuming that the person is authorized to do so, for example, an attorney for the movant. The Committee envisions that the courts would apply third-party, or \u201cnext-friend,\u201d standing analysis in deciding whether the signer was actually authorized to sign the motion on behalf of the movant. See generally Whitmore v. ArkansasSee alsoThe language in new Rule 2(c) has been changed to reflect that a moving party must substantially follow the standard form, which is appended to the rules, or a form provided by the court. The current rule, Rule 2(c), seems to indicate a preference for the standard \u201cnational\u201d form. Under the amended rule, there is no stated preference. The Committee understood that the current practice in some courts is that if the moving party first files a motion using the national form, that courts may ask the moving party to supplement it with the local form.Current Rule 2(d), which provided for returning an insufficient motion[,] has been deleted. The Committee believed that the approach in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e) was more appropriate for dealing with motions that do not conform to the form requirements of the rule. That Rule provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Before the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214seeChanges Made After Publication and CommentsRule 2(b)(4) was also modified to reflect that some motions may be printed using a word processing program.Finally, Rule 2(b)(5) was changed to emphasize that any person, other than the petitioner, who signs the petition must be authorized to do so.Amendments1976\u2014Subd.

Filing the Motion; Inmate Filing(a) Where to File; Copies(b) Filing and Service(c) Time to File(d) Inmate Filing(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Advisory Committee NoteThere is no filing fee required of a movant under these rules. This is a change from the practice of charging $15 and is done to recognize specifically the nature of a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion as being a continuation of the criminal case whose judgment is under attack.The long-standing practice of requiring a $15 filing fee has followed from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1914(a) whereby \u201cparties instituting any civil action *\u2000*\u2000* pay a filing fee of $15, except that on an application for a writ of habeas corpus the filing fee shall be $5.\u201d This has been held to apply to a proceeding under \u00a7\u202f2255 despite the rationale that such a proceeding is a motion and thus a continuation of the criminal action. (See note to rule 1.)A motion under Section 2255 is a civil action and the clerk has no choice but to charge a $15.00 filing fee unless by leave of court it is filed in forma pauperis.McCuneUnited StatesAlthough the motion has been considered to be a new civil action in the nature of habeas corpus for filing purposes, the reduced fee for habeas has been held not applicable. The Tenth Circuit considered the specific issue in MartinUnited StatesCounsel for Martin insists that, if a docket fee must be paid, the amount is $5 rather than $15 and bases his contention on the exception contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f1914 that in habeas corpus the fee is $5. This reads into \u00a7\u202f1914 language which is not there. While an application under \u00a7\u202f2255 may afford the same relief as that previously obtainable by habeas corpus, it is not a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. A change in \u00a7\u202f1914 must come from Congress.273 F.2d at 778Although for most situations \u00a7\u202f2255 is intended to provide to the federal prisoner a remedy equivalent to habeas corpus as used by state prisoners, there is a major distinction between the two. Calling a \u00a7\u202f2255 request f", "or relief a motion rather than a petition militates toward charging no new filing fee, not an increased one. In the absence of convincing evidence to the contrary, there is no reason to suppose that Congress did not mean what it said in making a \u00a7\u202f2255 action a motion. Therefore, as in other motions filed in a criminal action, there is no requirement of a filing fee. It is appropriate that the present situation of docketing a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion as a new action and charging a $15 filing fee be remedied by the rule when the whole question of \u00a7\u202f2255 motions is thoroughly thought through and organized.Even though there is no need to have a forma pauperis affidavit to proceed with the action since there is no requirement of a fee for filing the motion the affidavit remains attached to the form to be supplied potential movants. Most such movants are indigent, and this is a convenient way of getting this into the official record so that the judge may appoint counsel, order the government to pay witness fees, allow docketing of an appeal, and grant any other rights to which an indigent is entitled in the course of a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion, when appropriate to the particular situation, without the need for an indigency petition and adjudication at such later point in the proceeding. This should result in a streamlining of the process to allow quicker disposition of these motions.For further discussion of this rule, see the advisory committee note to rule 3 of the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 3 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as indicated below.Revised Rule 3(b) is new and is intended to parallel Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(e), which provides that the clerk may not refuse to accept a filing solely for the reason that it fails to comply with these rules or local rules. Befo", "re the adoption of a one-year statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214seeRevised Rule 3(c), which sets out a specific reference to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255, paragraph 6, is new and has been added to put moving parties on notice that a one-year statute of limitations applies to motions filed under these Rules. Although the rule does not address the issue, every circuit that has addressed the issue has taken the position that equitable tolling of the statute of limitations is available in appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., Dunlap v. United StatesMoore v. United StatesSandvik v. United StatesSee Duncan v. WalkerRule 3(d) is new and provides guidance on determining whether a motion from an inmate is considered to have been filed in a timely fashion. The new provision parallels Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(C).Changes Made After Publication and CommentsRule 4. Preliminary Review(a) Referral to a Judge(b) Initial Consideration by the Judge(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Advisory Committee NoteRule 4 outlines the procedure for assigning the motion to a specific judge of the district court and the options available to the judge and the government after the motion is properly filed.The long-standing majority practice in assigning motions made pursuant to \u00a7\u202f2255 has been for the trial judge to determine the merits of the motion. In cases where the \u00a7\u202f2255 motion is directed against the sentence, the merits have traditionally been decided by the judge who imposed sentence. The reasoning for this was first noted in Currell v. United StatesComplaint is made that the judge who tried the case passed upon the motion. Not only was there no impropriety in this, but it is highly desirable in such cases that the motions be passed on by the judge who is familiar with the facts and circumstances surrounding the trial, and is consequently not likely to be misled by false allegations as to what occurred.This case, and its reasoning, has been almost unanimously endo", "rsed by other courts dealing with the issue.Commentators have been critical of having the motion decided by the trial judge. See Developments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 1038, 1206\u20131208 (1970).[T]he trial judge may have become so involved with the decision that it will be difficult for him to review it objectively. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that \u201ccourt\u201d refers to a specific judge, and the procedural advantages of section 2255 are available whether or not the trial judge presides at the hearing.The theory that Congress intended the trial judge to preside at a section 2255 hearing apparently originated in Carvell v. United States83 Harv.L.Rev. at 1207\u20131208The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has held that a judge other than the trial judge should rule on the 2255 motion. See Halliday v. United StatesThere is a procedure by which the movant can have a judge other than the trial judge decide his motion in courts adhering to the majority rule. He can file an affidavit alleging bias in order to disqualify the trial judge. And there are circumstances in which the trial judge will, on his own, disqualify himself. See, e.g., Webster v. United StatesSubdivision (a) adopts the majority rule and provides that the trial judge, or sentencing judge if different and appropriate for the particular motion, will decide the motion made pursuant to these rules, recognizing that, under some circumstances, he may want to disqualify himself. A movant is not without remedy if he feels this is unfair to him. He can file an affidavit of bias. And there is the right to appellate review if the trial judge refuses to grant his motion. Because the trial judge is thoroughly familiar with the case, there is obvious administrative advantage in giving him the first opportunity to decide whether there are grounds for granting the motion.Since the motion is part of the criminal action in which was entered the judgment to which it is directed, the files, records, transcripts, and correspondence relating to", " that judgment are automatically available to the judge in his consideration of the motion. He no longer need order them incorporated for that purpose.Rule 4 has its basis in \u00a7\u202f2255 (rather than 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2243 in the corresponding habeas corpus rule) which does not have a specific time limitation as to when the answer must be made. Also, under \u00a7\u202f2255, the United States Attorney for the district is the party served with the notice and a copy of the motion and required to answer (when appropriate). Subdivision (b) continues this practice since there is no respondent involved in the motion (unlike habeas) and the United States Attorney, as prosecutor in the case in question, is the most appropriate one to defend the judgment and oppose the motion.The judge has discretion to require an answer or other appropriate response from the United States Attorney. See advisory committee note to rule 4 of the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 4 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.The amended rule reflects that the response to a Section 2255 motion may be a motion to dismiss or some other response.Changes Made After Publication and CommentsRule 5. The Answer and the Reply(a) When Required(b) Contents(c) Records of Prior Proceedings(d) Reply(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Apr. 25, 2019Dec. 1, 2019Advisory Committee NoteUnlike the habeas corpus statutes (see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u202f2243, 2248) \u00a7\u202f2255 does not specifically call for a return or answer by the United States Attorney or set any time limits as to when one must be submitted. The general practice, however, if the motion is not summarily dismissed, is for the government to file an answer to the motion as well as counter-affidavits, when appropriate. Rule 4 provides for an answer to the motion by the United States Attorney, and rule 5 i", "ndicates what its contents should be.There is no requirement that the movant exhaust his remedies prior to seeking relief under \u00a7\u202f2255. However, the courts have held that such a motion is inappropriate if the movant is simultaneously appealing the decision.We are of the view that there is no jurisdictional bar to the District Court\u2019s entertaining a Section 2255 motion during the pendency of a direct appeal but that the orderly administration of criminal law precludes considering such a motion absent extraordinary circumstances.Womack v. United StatesAlso see Masters v. EideThere is nothing in \u00a7\u202f2255 which corresponds to the \u00a7\u202f2248 requirement of a traverse to the answer. Numerous cases have held that the government\u2019s answer and affidavits are not conclusive against the movant, and if they raise disputed issues of fact a hearing must be held. Machibroda v. United StatesUnited States v. SalernoRomero v. United StatesScott v. United StatesSchiebelhut v. United StatesDel Piano v. United StatesSubdivision (b) provides for the government to supplement its answers with appropriate copies of transcripts or briefs if for some reason the judge does not already have them under his control. This is because the government will in all probability have easier access to such papers than the movant, and it will conserve the court\u2019s time to have the government produce them rather than the movant, who would in most instances have to apply in forma pauperis for the government to supply them for him anyway.For further discussion, see the advisory committee note to rule 5 of the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 5 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended.Revised Rule 5(a), which provides that the respondent is not required to file an answer to the motion, unless a judge so orders, is taken from cur", "rent Rule 3(b). The revised rule does not address the practice in some districts, where the respondent files a pre-answer motion to dismiss the motion. But revised Rule 4(b) contemplates that practice and has been changed to reflect the view that if the court does not dismiss the motion, it may require (or permit) the respondent to file a motion.Finally, revised Rule 5(d) adopts the practice in some jurisdictions giving the movant an opportunity to file a reply to the respondent\u2019s answer. Rather than using terms such as \u201ctraverse,\u201d seeChanges Made After Publication and CommentsFinally, the Committee changed the Note to address the use of the term \u201ctraverse,\u201d a point raised by one of the commentators on the proposed rule.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142019 AmendmentThe moving party has a right to file a reply. Subsection (d), added in 2004, removed the discretion of the court to determine whether or not to allow the moving party to file a reply in a case under \u00a7\u202f2255. The current amendment was prompted by decisions holding that courts nevertheless retained the authority to bar a reply.As amended, the first sentence of subsection (d) makes it even clearer that the moving party has a right to file a reply to the respondent\u2019s answer or pleading. It retains the word \u201cmay,\u201d which is used throughout the federal rules to mean \u201cis permitted to\u201d or \u201chas a right to.\u201d No change in meaning is intended by the substitution of \u201cfile\u201d for \u201csubmit.\u201dAs amended, the second sentence of the rule retains the court\u2019s discretion to decide when the reply must be filed (but not whether it may be filed). To avoid uncertainty, the amended rule requires the court to set a time for filing if that time is not already set by local rule. Adding a reference to the time for the filing of any reply to the order requiring the government to file an answer or other pleading provides notice of that deadline to both parties.Rule 6. Discovery(a) Leave of Court Required(b) Requesting Discovery(c) Deposition Expenses(As amended Apr. 26, 2004Dec. 1, 2004Advisory C", "ommittee NoteThis rule differs from the corresponding discovery rule under the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules in that it includes the processes of discovery available under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as well as the civil. This is because of the nature of a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion as a continuing part of the criminal proceeding (see advisory committee note to rule 1) as well as a remedy analogous to habeas corpus by state prisoners.See the advisory committee note to rule 6 of the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules. The discussion there is fully applicable to discovery under these rules for \u00a7\u202f2255 motions.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 6 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as indicated below.Although current Rule 6(b) contains no requirement that the parties provide reasons for the requested discovery, the revised rule does so and also includes a requirement that the request be accompanied by any proposed interrogatories and requests for admission, and must specify any requested documents. The Committee believes that the revised rule makes explicit what has been implicit in current practice.Changes Made After Publication and Comments\nReferences in TextThe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, referred to in subd.

United StatesIt has also been held that delay in filing a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion does not bar the movant because of lack of reasonable diligence in pressing the claim.The statute [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255], when it states that the motion may be made at any time, excludes the addition of a showing of diligence in delayed filings. A number of courts have considered contentions similar to those made here and have concluded that there are no time limitations. This result excludes the requirement of diligence which is in reality a time limitation.Haier v. United StatesOther courts have recognized that delay may have a negative effect on the movant. In Raines v. United States[B]oth petitioners\u2019 silence for extended periods, one for 28 months and the other for nine years, serves to render their allegations less believable. \u201cAlthough a delay in filing a section 2255 motion is not a controlling element *\u2000*\u2000* it may merit some consideration *\u2000*\u2000*.\u201d423 F.2d at 531In Aiken v. United StatesParker v. United StatesLe Clair v. United StatesMalone v. United StatesHowell v. United StatesUnited States v. WigginsThere have been holdings by some courts that a delay in filing a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion operates to increase the burden of proof which the movant must meet to obtain relief. The reasons for this, as expressed in United States v. BosticObviousl", "y, the burden of proof on a motion to vacate a sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255 is on the moving party. .\u2000.\u2000. The burden is particularly heavy if the issue is one of fact and a long time has elapsed since the trial of the case. While neither the statute of limitations nor laches can bar the assertion of a constitutional right, nevertheless, the passage of time may make it impracticable to retry a case if the motion is granted and a new trial is ordered. No doubt, at times such a motion is a product of an afterthought. Long delay may raise a question of good faith.206 F.Supp. at 856\u2013857See also United States v. WigginsA requirement that the movant display reasonable diligence in filing a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion has been adopted by some courts dealing with delayed motions. The court in United States v. Moore[W]e agree with the District Court that the petitioner has too long slept upon his rights. *\u2000*\u2000* [A]pparently there is no limitation of time within which *\u2000*\u2000* a motion to vacate may be filed, except that an applicant must show reasonable diligence in presenting his claim. *\u2000*\u2000*The reasons which support the rule requiring diligence seem obvious. *\u2000*\u2000* Law enforcement officials change, witnesses die, memories grow dim. The prosecuting tribunal is put to a disadvantage if an unexpected retrial should be necessary after long passage of time.166 F.2d at 105In accord see Desmond v. United StatesOne of the major arguments advanced by the courts which would penalize a movant who waits an unduly long time before filing a \u00a7\u202f2255 motion is that such delay is highly prejudicial to the prosecution. In Desmond v. United States[A]pplications for relief such as this must be made promptly. It will not do for a prisoner to wait until government witnesses have become unavailable as by death, serious illness or absence from the country, or until the memory of available government witnesses has faded. It will not even do for a prisoner to wait any longer than is reasonably necessary to prepare appropriate moving papers, however inartistic, af", "ter discovery of the deception practiced upon him by his attorney.333 F.2d at 381In a similar vein are United States v. MooreUnited States v. BosticUnited States v. WigginsSubdivision (a) provides a flexible, equitable time limitation based on laches to prevent movants from withholding their claims so as to prejudice the government both in meeting the allegations of the motion and in any possible retrial. It includes a reasonable diligence requirement for ascertaining possible grounds for relief. If the delay is found to be excusable, or nonprejudicial to the government, the time bar is inoperative.Subdivision (b) is consistent with the language of \u00a7\u202f2255 and relevant case law.The annexed form is intended to serve the same purpose as the comparable one included in the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules.For further discussion applicable to this rule, see the advisory committee note to rule 9 of the \u00a7\u202f2254 rules.Committee Notes on Rules\u20142004 AmendmentThe language of Rule 9 has been amended as part of general restyling of the rules to make them more easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent throughout the rules. These changes are intended to be stylistic and no substantive change is intended, except as indicated below.First, current Rule 9(a) has been deleted as unnecessary in light of the applicable one-year statute of limitations for \u00a7\u202f2255 motions, added as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255, para. 6.Second, the remainder of revised Rule 9 reflects provisions in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f2255, parh. [sic] 8, which now require a moving party to obtain approval from the appropriate court of appeals before filing a second or successive motion.Finally, the title of the rule has been changed to reflect the fact that the revised version addresses only the topic of second or successive motions.Changes Made After Publication and CommentsAmendments by Public Law1976\u2014Subd.

This result has often been explained on the ground that rule 4(a) has to do with civil cases and that \u201cproceedings under section 2255 are civil in nature.\u201d E.g., Rothman v.

It follows recommendations of a committee appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States, composed of Circuit Judges Evan A. Evans, Kimbrough Stone, Orie L. Phillips, and Albert B. Maris.The committee pointed out that section 380a of title 28This section governs only the composition and procedure of three-judge district courts. The requirement that applications for injunctions be heard and determined by such courts will appear in other sections of this and other titles of the United States Code as Congress may enact from time to time.

In actions or suits involving liens arising under the internal revenue laws, the complaint", " or pleading shall include the name and address of the taxpayer whose liability created the lien and, if a notice of the tax lien was filed, the identity of the internal revenue office which filed the notice, and the date and place such notice of lien was filed. In actions in the State courts service upon the United States shall be made by serving the process of the court with a copy of the complaint upon the United States attorney for the district in which the action is brought or upon an assistant United States attorney or clerical employee designated by the United States attorney in writing filed with the clerk of the court in which the action is brought and by sending copies of the process and complaint, by registered mail, or by certified mail, to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, District of Columbia. In such actions the United States may appear and answer, plead or demur within sixty days after such service or such further time as the court may allow.(c) A judgment or decree in such action or suit shall have the same effect respecting the discharge of the property from the mortgage or other lien held by the United States as may be provided with respect to such matters by the local law of the place where the court is situated. However, an action to foreclose a mortgage or other lien, naming the United States as a party under this section, must seek judicial sale. A sale to satisfy a lien inferior to one of the United States shall be made subject to and without disturbing the lien of the United States, unless the United States consents that the property may be sold free of its lien and the proceeds divided as the parties may be entitled. Where a sale of real estate is made to satisfy a lien prior to that of the United States, the United States shall have one year from the date of sale within which to redeem, except that with respect to a lien arising under the internal revenue laws the period shall be 120 days or the period allowable for redemption under State law, whichever is longer,", " and in any case in which, under the provisions of section 505 of the Housing Act of 1950, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1701ksection 3720 of title 38(d) In any case in which the United States redeems real property under this section or section 7425 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the amount to be paid for such property shall be the sum of\u2014(1) the actual amount paid by the purchaser at such sale (which, in the case of a purchaser who is the holder of the lien being foreclosed, shall include the amount of the obligation secured by such lien to the extent satisfied by reason of such sale),(2) interest on the amount paid (as determined under paragraph (1)) at 6 percent per annum from the date of such sale, and(3) the amount (if any) equal to the excess of (A) the expenses necessarily incurred in connection with such property, over (B) the income from such property plus (to the extent such property is used by the purchaser) a reasonable rental value of such property.(e) Whenever any person has a lien upon any real or personal property, duly recorded in the jurisdiction in which the property is located, and a junior lien, other than a tax lien, in favor of the United States attaches to such property, such person may make a written request to the officer charged with the administration of the laws in respect of which the lien of the United States arises, to have the same extinguished. If after appropriate investigation, it appears to such officer that the proceeds from the sale of the property would be insufficient to wholly or partly satisfy the lien of the United States, or that the claim of the United States has been satisfied or by lapse of time or otherwise has become unenforceable, such officer may issue a certificate releasing the property from such lien.(June 25, 1948, ch. 64662 Stat. 972May 24, 1949, ch. 139, \u00a7\u202f11963 Stat. 105Pub.

L. 109\u2013177, title IV, \u00a7\u202f410Mar. 9, 2006120 Stat. 246\nHistorical and Revision NotesSubsection (a) was drafted to clarify a serious ambiguity in existing law and is based upon rulings of the Supreme Court. Numerous sections in the United States Code prescribe civil fines, penalties, and pecuniary forfeitures for violation of certain sections without specifying the mode of recovery or enforcement thereof. See, for example, section 567 of title 12section 64 of title 14section 180 of title 25A civil fine, penalty, or pecuniary forfeiture is recoverable in a civil action. United States ex rel. Marcus v. HessHepner v. United StatesForfeiture of bail bonds in criminal cases are enforceable by procedure set out in Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.If the statute contemplates a criminal fine, it can only be recovered in a criminal proceeding under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, after a conviction. The collection of civil fines and penalties, however, may not be had under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 54(b)(5), but enforcement ", "of a criminal fine imposed in a criminal case may be had by execution on the judgment rendered in such case, as in civil actions. (See section 569 of title 18Subsection (b) was drafted to cover the subject of forfeiture of property generally. Sections in the United States Code specifically providing a mode of enforcement of forfeiture of property for their violation and other procedural matters will, of course, govern and subsection (b) will not affect them. It will only cover cases where no mode of recovery is prescribed.Words \u201cUnless otherwise provided by enactment of Congress\u201d were inserted at the beginning of subsection (b) to exclude from its application instances where a libel in admiralty is not required. For example, under sections 1607, 1609, and 1610 of title 19, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Customs Duties, the collector of customs may, by summary procedure, sell at public auction, without previous declaration of forfeiture or libel proceedings, any vessel, etc., under $1,000 in value in cases where no claim for the same is filed or bond given as required by customs laws.Rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure makes such rules applicable to the appeals in cases of seizures on land. (See also 443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United StatesEureka Productions v. MulliganEureka Productions v. MulliganIn re Graham443 Cans of Frozen Egg Product v. United StatesSubsection (b) is in conformity with Rule 21 of the Supreme Court Admiralty Rules, which recognizes that a libel may be filed upon seizure for any breach of any enactment of Congress, whether on land or on the high seas or on navigable waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States. Such rule also permits an information to be filed, but is rarely, if ever, used at present.

L. 100\u2013694, \u00a7\u202f2Nov. 18, 1988102 Stat. 4563\n\u201c(a) FindingsThe Congress finds and declares the following:\u201c(1) For more than 40 years the Federal Tort Claims Act [see Short Title note above] has been the legal mechanism for compensating persons injured by negligent or wrongful acts of Federal employees committed within the scope of their employment.\u201c(2) The United States, through the Federal Tort Claims Act, is responsible to injured persons for the common law torts of its employees in the same manner in which the common law historically has recognized the responsibility of an employer for torts committed by its employees within the scope of their employment.\u201c(3) Because Federal employees for many years have been protected from personal common law tort liability by a broad based immunity, the Federal Tort Claims Act has served as the sole means for compensating persons injured by the tortious conduct of Federal employees.\u201c(4) Recent judicial decisions, and particularly the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Westfall v. Erwin, have seriously eroded the common law tort immunity previously available to Federal employees.\u201c(5) This erosion of immunity of Federal employees from common law tort liability has created an immediate crisis involving the prospect of personal liability and the threat of protracted personal tort litigation for the entire Federal workforce.\u201c(6) The prospect of such liability will seriously undermine the morale and well being of Federal employees, impede the ability of agencies to carry out their missions, and diminish the vitality of the Federal Tort Claims Act as the proper remedy for Federal employee torts.\u201c(7) In its opinion in Westfall v. Erwin, the Supreme Court indicated that the Congress is in the best position to determine the extent to which Federal employees should be personally liable for common law torts, and that legislative consideration of this matter would be useful.\u201c(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note under secti", "on 1 of this title \u00a7\u202f2672.

L. 111\u2013223, \u00a7\u202f2Aug. 10, 2010124 Stat. 2380\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) The freedom of speech and the press is enshrined in the first amendment to the Constitution, and is necessary to promote the vigorous dialogue necessary to shape public policy in a representative democracy.\u201c(2) Some persons are obstructing the free expression rights of United States authors and publishers, and in turn chilling the first amendment to the Constitution of the Unit", "ed States interest of the citizenry in receiving information on matters of importance, by seeking out foreign jurisdictions that do not provide the full extent of free-speech protections to authors and publishers that are available in the United States, and suing a United States author or publisher in that foreign jurisdiction.\u201c(3) These foreign defamation lawsuits not only suppress the free speech rights of the defendants to the suit, but inhibit other written speech that might otherwise have been written or published but for the fear of a foreign lawsuit.\u201c(4) The threat of the libel laws of some foreign countries is so dramatic that the United Nations Human Rights Committee examined the issue and indicated that in some instances the law of libel has served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work. The advent of the internet and the international distribution of foreign media also create the danger that one country\u2019s unduly restrictive libel law will affect freedom of expression worldwide on matters of valid public interest.\u201c(5) Governments and courts of foreign countries scattered around the world have failed to curtail this practice of permitting libel lawsuits against United States persons within their courts, and foreign libel judgments inconsistent with United States first amendment protections are increasingly common.\u201d \u00a7\u202f4102.

Worker Organizing and EmpowermentEx. Ord. No. 14025, Apr. 26, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicy and Findings29 U.S.C. 1515 U.S.C. 7101(a)(1)In the past few decades, the Federal Government has not used its full authority to promote and implement this policy of support for workers organizing unions and bargaining collectively with their employers. During this period, economic change in the United States and globally, technological developments, and the failure to modernize Federal organizing and labor-management relations laws to respond appropriately to the reality found in American workplaces, have made worker organizing exceedingly difficult.The result has been a steady decline in union density in the United States and the loss of worker power and voice in workplaces and communities across the country. This decline has had a host of negative consequences for American workers and the economy, including weakening and shrinking America\u2019s middle class. Meanwhile, some workers have been excluded from opportunities to organize unions and bargain collectively with their employers by law or practice, and so have never been able to build meaningful economic power or have a voice in their workplaces.Confirming the policies declared in Federal labor laws, substantial evidence shows that union membership increases wages, the likelihood of receiving employer-provided benefits, and job security. Union membership also gives workers the means to build the power to ensure that their voices are heard in their workplaces, their communities, and in the Nation.Therefore, it is the policy of my Administration to encourage worker organizing and collective bargaining.Sec.Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment(a) The Vice President shall serve as Chair of the Task Force. In addition to the Vice Pre", "sident, the Task Force shall consist of the following officials or their designees:(i) the Secretary of Labor, who shall serve as Vice Chair of the Task Force;(ii) the Secretary of the Treasury;(iii) the Secretary of Defense;(iv) the Secretary of the Interior;(v) the Secretary of Agriculture;(vi) the Secretary of Commerce;(vii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;(viii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;(ix) the Secretary of Transportation;(x) the Secretary of Energy;(xi) the Secretary of Education;(xii) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;(xiii) the Secretary of Homeland Security;(xiv) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency;(xv) the Administrator of General Services;(xvi) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;(xvii) the United States Trade Representative;(xviii) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;(xix) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;(xx) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;(xxi) the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy;(xxii) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy;(xxiii) the Assistant to the President and National Climate Advisor; and(xxiv) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the President may from time to time designate upon the recommendation of the Chair of the Task Force.(b) The Task Force and its members shall identify executive branch policies, practices, and programs that could be used, consistent with applicable law, to promote my Administration\u2019s policy of support for worker power, worker organizing, and collective bargaining. This identification shall include policies, practices, and programs that could be used to promote worker power in areas of the country with hostile labor laws, for marginalized workers (including women and persons of color) and hard-to-organize industries, and in changing industries. The Task Force and its members also shall identify statutory, regulatory, or other changes that may be necessary to make policies, practices, a", "nd programs more effective means of supporting worker organizing and collective bargaining.(c) The functions of the Task Force are advisory in nature only; the purpose of the Task Force is to make recommendations regarding changes to policies, practices, programs, and other changes that would serve the objectives of this order.(d) The Task Force should invite the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the National Mediation Board, and other executive agencies, boards, and commissions with responsibility for implementing laws concerning worker organizing and collective bargaining to consult, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, with the Task Force.(e) The Chair may establish such sub-committees or other working groups composed of Task Force members or their representatives as may be necessary to accomplish the objectives of this order.(f) Consistent with the objectives of this order and applicable law, the Task Force may gather relevant information from labor organizations, other worker advocates, academic and other experts, and other entities and persons it identifies that will assist the Task Force in accomplishing the objectives of this order.(g) The Task Force shall, within 180 days of the date of this order [Apr. 26, 2021Sec.Definitions(a) \u201cPolicies, practices, and programs\u201d includes regulations; guidance and other formal policy documents; procurements; grants and other direct or indirect Federal investments; tax and trade administration and enforcement; administration and enforcement of labor, employment, and other relevant laws; property management; and human resources management and labor relations.(b) \u201cWorker organizing and collective bargaining\u201d encompasses the private sector, State and local governments, and the Federal Government.

Separability\nIf any provision of this chapter, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, shall be held invalid, the remainder of this chapter, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby.(June 23, 1947, ch. 12061 Stat. 162 \u00a7\u202f151. Findings and declaration of policy\nThe denial by some employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by some employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by (a) impairing the efficiency, safety, or operation of the instrumentalities of commerce; (b) occurring in the current of commerce; (c) materially affecting, restraining, or controlling the flow of raw materials or manufactured or processed goods from or into the channels of commerce, or the prices of such materials or goods in commerce; or (d) causing diminution of employment and wages in such volume as substantially to impair or disrupt the market for goods flowing from or into the channels of commerce.The inequality of bargain", "ing power between employees who do not possess full freedom of association or actual liberty of contract, and employers who are organized in the corporate or other forms of ownership association substantially burdens and affects the flow of commerce, and tends to aggravate recurrent business depressions, by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wage earners in industry and by preventing the stabilization of competitive wage rates and working conditions within and between industries.Experience has proved that protection by law of the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively safeguards commerce from injury, impairment, or interruption, and promotes the flow of commerce by removing certain recognized sources of industrial strife and unrest, by encouraging practices fundamental to the friendly adjustment of industrial disputes arising out of differences as to wages, hours, or other working conditions, and by restoring equality of bargaining power between employers and employees.Experience has further demonstrated that certain practices by some labor organizations, their officers, and members have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce by preventing the free flow of goods in such commerce through strikes and other forms of industrial unrest or through concerted activities which impair the interest of the public in the free flow of such commerce. The elimination of such practices is a necessary condition to the assurance of the rights herein guaranteed.It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and conditions of their employment o", "r other mutual aid or protection.(July 5, 1935, ch. 372, \u00a7\u202f149 Stat. 449June 23, 1947, ch. 12061 Stat. 136\nEditorial NotesAmendments1947\u2014Act June 23, 1947Statutory Notes and Related SubsidiariesEffective Date of 1947 AmendmentAct June 23, 1947, ch. 120, title I, \u00a7\u202f10461 Stat. 152\u201cThe amendments made by this title [amending this subchapter] shall take effect sixty days after the date of the enactment of this Act [June 23, 1947section 153 of this title \u00a7\u202f152.

Congressional declaration of findings, purposes, and policy(a) Standards for labor-management relationsThe Congress finds that, in the public interest, it continues to be the responsibility of the Federal Government to protect employees\u2019 rights to organize, choo", "se their own representatives, bargain collectively, and otherwise engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid or protection; that the relations between employers and labor organizations and the millions of workers they represent have a substantial impact on the commerce of the Nation; and that in order to accomplish the objective of a free flow of commerce it is essential that labor organizations, employers, and their officials adhere to the highest standards of responsibility and ethical conduct in administering the affairs of their organizations, particularly as they affect labor-management relations.(b) Protection of rights of employees and the publicThe Congress further finds, from recent investigations in the labor and management fields, that there have been a number of instances of breach of trust, corruption, disregard of the rights of individual employees, and other failures to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct which require further and supplementary legislation that will afford necessary protection of the rights and interests of employees and the public generally as they relate to the activities of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives.(c) Necessity to eliminate or prevent improper practicesThe Congress, therefore, further finds and declares that the enactment of this chapter is necessary to eliminate or prevent improper practices on the part of labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and their officers and representatives which distort and defeat the policies of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended [29 U.S.C. 14145 U.S.C. 151(Pub.

In the event of conflict among any such standards, the Secretary shall promulgate the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees.(b) Procedure for promulgation, modification, or revocation of standardsThe Secretary may by rule promulgate, modify, or revoke any occupational safety or health standard in the following manner:(1) Whenever the Secretary, upon the basis of information submitted to him in writing by an interested person, a representative of any organization of employers or employees, a nationally recognized standards-producing organization, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or a State or political subdivision, or on the basis of information developed by the Secretary or otherwise available to him, determines that a rule should be promulgated in order to serve the objectives of this chapter, the Secretary may request the recommendations of an advisory committee appointed under section 656 of this title(2) The Secretary shall publish a proposed rule promulgating, modifying, or revoking an occupational safety or health standard in the Federal Register and shall afford interested persons a period of thirty days after publication to submit written data or comments.

Development of standards under this subsection shall be based upon research, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as may be appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree of health and safety protection for ", "the employee, other considerations shall be the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility of the standards, and experience gained under this and other health and safety laws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.(6)(A) Any employer may apply to the Secretary for a temporary order granting a variance from a standard or any provision thereof promulgated under this section. Such temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of clause (B) and establishes that (i) he is unable to comply with a standard by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date, (ii) he is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the standard, and (iii) he has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard as quickly as practicable.

The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, and the practices, means, methods, operations, and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees, or by the Secretary on his own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this subsection at any time after six months from its issuance.(e) Statement of reasons for Secretary\u2019s determinations; publication in Federal RegisterWhenever the Secretary promulgates any standard, makes any rule, order, or decision, grants any exemption or extension of time, or compromises, mitigates, or settles any penalty assessed under this chapter, he shall include a statement of the reasons for such action, which shall be published in the Federal Register.(f) Judicial reviewAny person who may be adversely affected by a standard issued under this section may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard is promulgated file a petition challenging the validity of such standard with the United States court of appeals for the ci", "rcuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review of such standard.
