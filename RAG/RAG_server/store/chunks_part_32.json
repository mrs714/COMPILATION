FindingsThe Congress finds and declares the following:(1) There is a Federal responsibility to provide opportunities for public recreation at Federal water projects.(2) Some provisions of the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [16 U.S.C. 460l(3) Provisions of such Act relating to non-Federal responsibility for all costs of operation, maintenance, and replacement of recreation facilities result in an unfair burden, especially in cases where the facilities are old or underdesigned.(4) Provisions of such Act that limit the Federal share of recreation facility development at water projects completed before 1965 to $100,000 preclude a responsible Federal share in providing adequate opportunities for safe outdoor recreation.(5) There should be Federal authority to expand existing recreation facilities to meet public demand, in partnership with non-Federal interests.(6) Nothing in this part changes the responsibility of the Bureau to meet the purposes for which Federal Reclamation projects were initially authorized and constructed.(7) It is therefore in the best interest of the people of this Nation to amend the Federal Water Project Recreation Act [16 U.S.C. 460l(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds the following:(1) The public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management in the State of Idaho within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area contain one of the densest known nesting populations of eagles, falcons, owls, hawks, and other birds of prey (raptors) in North America.(2) These public lands constitute a valuable national biological and educational resource since birds of prey are important components of the ecosystem and indicators of environmental quality, and contribute significantly to the quality of wildlife and human communities.(3) These public lands also contain important historic and cultural resources (including significant archaeological resources) as ", "well as other resources and values, all of which should be protected and appropriately managed.(4) A military training area within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area, known as the Orchard Training Area, has been used since 1953 by reserve components of the Armed Forces. Military use of this area is currently governed by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Bureau of Land Management and the State of Idaho Military Division, dated May 1985. Operating under this Memorandum of Understanding, the Idaho National Guard has provided valuable assistance to the Bureau of Land Management with respect to fire control and other aspects of management of the Orchard Training Area and the other lands in the Snake River Birds of Prey Area. Military use of the lands within the Orchard Training Area should continue in accordance with such Memorandum of Understanding (or extension or renewal thereof), to the extent consistent with section 460iii\u20133(e) of this title(5) Protection of the conservation area as a home for raptors can best and should be accomplished by the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Land Management, under a management plan that\u2014(A) emphasizes management, protection, and rehabilitation of habitat for these raptors and of other resources and values of the area;(B) provides for continued military use, consistent with the requirements of section 460iii\u20133(e) of this title(C) addresses the need for public educational and interpretive opportunities;(D) allows for diverse appropriate uses of lands in the area to the extent consistent with the maintenance and enhancement of raptor populations and habitats and protection and sound management of other resources and values of the area; and(E) demonstrates management practices and techniques that may be useful to other areas of the public lands and elsewhere.(6) There exists near the conservation area a facility, the World Center for Birds of Prey operated by The Peregrine Fund, Inc., where research, public education, recovery, and reestablishment oper", "ations exist for endangered raptor species. There also exists at Boise State University a raptor study program which attracts national and international graduate and undergraduate students.(7) The Bureau of Land Management and Boise State University, together with other State, Federal, and private entities, have formed the Raptor Research and Technical Assistance Center to be housed at Boise State University, which provides a unique adjunct to the conservation area for raptor management, recovery, research, and public visitation, interpretation, and education.(8) Consistent with requirements of sections 1712 and 1732 of title 43, the Secretary has developed a comprehensive management plan and, based on such plan, has implemented a management program for the public lands included in the conservation area established by this subchapter.(9) Additional authority and guidance must be provided to assure that essential raptor habitat remains in public ownership, to facilitate sound and effective planning and management, to provide for effective public interpretation and education, to ensure continued study of the relationship of humans and these raptors, to preserve the unique and irreplaceable habitat of the conservation area, and to conserve and properly manage the other natural resources of the area in concert with maintenance of this habitat.(10) An ongoing research program funded by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Guard is intended to provide information to be used in connection with future decisionmaking concerning management of all uses, including continued military use, of public lands within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area.(11) Public lands in the Snake River Birds of Prey Area have been used for domestic livestock grazing for more than a century, with resultant benefits to community stability and contributions to the local and State economies. It has not been demonstrated that continuation of this use would be incompatible with appropriate protection and sound management of raptor habitat and", " the other resource values of these lands; therefore, subject to the determination provided for in section 460iii\u20133(f) of this title(12) Hydroelectric facilities for the generation and transmission of electricity exist within the Snake River Birds of Prey Area pursuant to a license(s) issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or its predecessor, the Federal Power Commission.(Pub.

It has not been demonstrated that continuation of this use would be incompatible with appropriate protection and sound management of the resource values of these lands; therefore, it is expected that such grazing will continue in accordance with the management plan for the conservation area and other applicable laws and regulations.(8) The Black Rock Desert playa is a unique natura", "l resource that serves as the primary destination for the majority of visitors to the conservation area, including visitors associated with large-scale permitted events. It is expected that such permitted events will continue to be administered in accordance with the management plan for the conservation area and other applicable laws and regulations.(Pub.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) certain parcels of private land located in central and southwest Washington are intermingled with National Forest System land owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as parts of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Wenatchee National Forest, and Gifford Pinchot National Forest;\u201c(2) the private land surface estate and some subsurface is owned by the Plum Creek Timber Company, L.P. in an intermingled checkerboard pattern, with the United States or Plum Creek owning alternate square mile sections of land or fractions of squ", "are mile sections;\u201c(3) the checkerboard land ownership pattern in the area has frustrated sound and efficient land management on both private and National Forest lands by complicating fish and wildlife habitat management, watershed protection, recreation use, road construction and timber harvest, boundary administration, and protection and management of threatened and endangered species and old growth forest habitat;\u201c(4) acquisition by the United States of certain parcels of land that have been offered by Plum Creek for addition to the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest will serve important public objectives, including\u2014\u201c(A) enhancement of public access, aesthetics and recreation opportunities within or near areas of very heavy public recreational use including\u2014\u201c(i) the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area;\u201c(ii) the Pacific Crest Trail;\u201c(iii) Snoqualmie Pass;\u201c(iv) Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake and Keechulus Lake; and\u201c(v) other popular recreation areas along the Interstate 90 corridor east of the Seattle-Tacoma Metropolitan Area;\u201c(B) protection and enhancement of old growth forests and habitat for threatened, endangered and sensitive species, including a net gain of approximately 28,500 acres of habitat for the northern spotted owl;\u201c(C) consolidation of National Forest holdings for more efficient administration and to meet a broad array of ecosystem protection and other public land management goals, including net public gains of approximately 283 miles of stream ownership, 14 miles of the route of the Pacific Crest Trail, 20,000 acres of unroaded land, and 7,360 acres of riparian land; and\u201c(D) a significant reduction in administrative costs to the United States through\u2014\u201c(i) consolidation of Federal land holdings for more efficient land management and planning;\u201c(ii) elimination of approximately 300 miles of boundary identification and posting;\u201c(iii) reduced right-of-way, special use, and other permit processing and issuance for roads and other facilities on National Forest System land; and\u201c(iv)", " other administrative cost savings;\u201c(5) Plum Creek has selected certain parcels of National Forest System land that are logical for consolidation into Plum Creek ownership utilizing a land exchange because the parcels\u2014\u201c(A) are intermingled with parcels owned by Plum Creek; and\u201c(B)(i) are generally located in less environmentally sensitive areas than the Plum Creek offered land; and\u201c(ii) have lower public recreation and other public values than the Plum Creek offered land;\u201c(6) time is of the essence in consummating a land exchange because delays may force Plum Creek to road or log the offered land and thereby diminish the public values for which the offered land is to be acquired; and\u201c(7) it is in the public interest to complete the land exchange at the earliest practicable date so that the offered land can be acquired and preserved by the United States for permanent public management, use, and enjoyment.\u201c(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this Act to further the public interest by authorizing, directing, facilitating, and expediting the consummation of the Interstate 90 land exchange so as to ensure that the offered land is expeditiously acquired for permanent public use and enjoyment.\u201cSEC. 603.

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Wenatchee National Forest, and Gifford Pinchot National Forest;\u201c(2) the private land surface estate and some subsurface is owned by the Plum Creek Timber Company, L.P. in an intermingled checkerboard pattern, with the United States or Plum Creek owning alternate square mile sections of land or fractions of square mile sections;\u201c(3) the checkerboard land ownership pattern in the area has frustrated sound an", "d efficient land management on both private and National Forest lands by complicating fish and wildlife habitat management, watershed protection, recreation use, road construction and timber harvest, boundary administration, and protection and management of threatened and endangered species and old growth forest habitat;\u201c(4) acquisition by the United States of certain parcels of land that have been offered by Plum Creek for addition to the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest will serve important public objectives, including\u2014\u201c(A) enhancement of public access, aesthetics and recreation opportunities within or near areas of very heavy public recreational use including\u2014\u201c(i) the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area;\u201c(ii) the Pacific Crest Trail;\u201c(iii) Snoqualmie Pass;\u201c(iv) Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake and Keechulus Lake; and\u201c(v) other popular recreation areas along the Interstate 90 corridor east of the Seattle-Tacoma Metropolitan Area;\u201c(B) protection and enhancement of old growth forests and habitat for threatened, endangered and sensitive species, including a net gain of approximately 28,500 acres of habitat for the northern spotted owl;\u201c(C) consolidation of National Forest holdings for more efficient administration and to meet a broad array of ecosystem protection and other public land management goals, including net public gains of approximately 283 miles of stream ownership, 14 miles of the route of the Pacific Crest Trail, 20,000 acres of unroaded land, and 7,360 acres of riparian land; and\u201c(D) a significant reduction in administrative costs to the United States through\u2014\u201c(i) consolidation of Federal land holdings for more efficient land management and planning;\u201c(ii) elimination of approximately 300 miles of boundary identification and posting;\u201c(iii) reduced right-of-way, special use, and other permit processing and issuance for roads and other facilities on National Forest System land; and\u201c(iv) other administrative cost savings;\u201c(5) Plum Creek has selected certain parcels of National Forest", " System land that are logical for consolidation into Plum Creek ownership utilizing a land exchange because the parcels\u2014\u201c(A) are intermingled with parcels owned by Plum Creek; and\u201c(B)(i) are generally located in less environmentally sensitive areas than the Plum Creek offered land; and\u201c(ii) have lower public recreation and other public values than the Plum Creek offered land;\u201c(6) time is of the essence in consummating a land exchange because delays may force Plum Creek to road or log the offered land and thereby diminish the public values for which the offered land is to be acquired; and\u201c(7) it is in the public interest to complete the land exchange at the earliest practicable date so that the offered land can be acquired and preserved by the United States for permanent public management, use, and enjoyment.\u201c(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this Act to further the public interest by authorizing, directing, facilitating, and expediting the consummation of the Interstate 90 land exchange so as to ensure that the offered land is expeditiously acquired for permanent public use and enjoyment. \u201cSEC. 603.
