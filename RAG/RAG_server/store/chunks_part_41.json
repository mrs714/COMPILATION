The loss of life attributable to the earthquake was massive.", "\u201c(3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, ranking 149 out of 182 countries according to the United Nation\u2019s Human Development Index.\u201c(4) In recent years, however, the Government and people of Haiti had taken important steps forward to promote economic growth and development, including making strides towards establishing a competitive apparel sector.\u201c(5) United States trade preference programs, including the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act [19 U.S.C. 2701Pub.

Findings and purposes(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) rapid growth in the world market for telecommunications products and services is likely to continue for several decades;(2) the United States can improve prospects for\u2014(A) the growth of\u2014(i) United States exports of telecommunications products and services, and(ii) export-related employment and consumer services in the United States, and(B) the continuance of the technological leadership of the United States,by undertaking a program to achieve an open world market for trade in telecommunications products, services, and investment;(3) most foreign markets for telecommunications products, services, and investment are characterized by extensive government intervention (including restrictive import practices and discriminatory procurement practices) which adversely affect United States exports of telecommunications products and services and United States investment in telecommunications;(4) the open nature of the United States telecommunications market, accruing from the liberalization and restructuring of such market, has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to an increase in imports of telecommunications products and a growing imbalance in competitive opportunities for trade in telecommunications;(5) unless this imbalance is corrected through the achievement of mutually advantageous market opportunities for trade in telecommunications products and services between the United States and foreign countries, the United States should avoid granting continued open access to the telecommunications products and services of such foreign countries in the United States market; and(6) the unique business conditions in the worldwide market for telecommunications products and servic", "es caused by the combination of deregulation and divestiture in the United States, which represents a unilateral liberalization of United States trade with the rest of the world, and continuing government intervention in the domestic industries of many other countries create a need to make an exception in the case of telecommunications products and services that should not necessarily be a precedent for legislating specific sectoral priorities in combating the closed markets or unfair foreign trade practices of other countries.(b) PurposesThe purposes of this chapter are\u2014(1) to foster the economic and technological growth of, and employment in, the United States telecommunications industry;(2) to secure a high quality telecommunications network for the benefit of the people of the United States;(3) to develop an international consensus in favor of open trade and competition in telecommunications products and services;(4) to ensure that countries which have made commitments to open telecommunications trade fully abide by those commitments; and(5) to achieve a more open world trading system for telecommunications products and services through negotiation and provision of mutually advantageous market opportunities for United States telecommunications exporters and their subsidiaries in those markets in which barriers exist to free international trade.(Pub.

C, title XXXI, \u00a7\u202f3102Aug. 6, 2002116 Stat. 1023\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act [19 U.S.C. 3201\u201c(2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the ", "Andean region, promoting export diversification and broad-based economic development that provides sustainable economic alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable alternatives to illicit trade in coca.\u201c(3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global competition for its legitimate trade.\u201c(4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a threat to the security interests of the United States and the world. This problem has been partially addressed through foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in 2000. However, foreign aid alone is not sufficient. Enhancement of legitimate trade with the United States provides an alternative means for reviving and stabilizing the economies in the Andean region.\u201c(5) The Andean Trade Preference Act constitutes a tangible commitment by the United States to the promotion of prosperity, stability, and democracy in the beneficiary countries.\u201c(6) Renewal and enhancement of the Andean Trade Preference Act will bolster the confidence of domestic private enterprise and foreign investors in the economic prospects of the region, ensuring that legitimate private enterprise can be the engine of economic development and political stability in the region.\u201c(7) Each of the Andean beneficiary countries is committed to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005, as a means of enhancing the economic security of the region.\u201c(8) Temporarily enhancing trade benefits for Andean beneficiary countries will promote the growth of free enterprise and economic opportunity in these countries and serve the security interests of the United States, the region, and the world.\u201d \u00a7\u202f3202.

FindingsCongress finds that\u2014(1) it is in the mutual interest of the United States and the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to promote stable and sustainable economic growth and development in sub-Saharan Africa;(2) the countries of sub-Saharan Africa form a region richly endowed with both natural and human resources;(3) sub-Saharan Africa represents a region of enormous economic potential and of enduring political significance to the United States;(4) the region has experienced the strengthening of democracy as countr", "ies in sub-Saharan Africa have taken steps to encourage broader participation in the political process;(5) certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa have increased their economic growth rates, taken significant steps towards liberalizing their economies, and made progress toward regional economic integration that can have positive benefits for the region;(6) despite those gains, the per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa averages approximately $500 annually;(7) trade and investment, as the American experience has shown, can represent powerful tools both for economic development and for encouraging broader participation in a political process in which political freedom can flourish;(8) increased trade and investment flows have the greatest impact in an economic environment in which trading partners eliminate barriers to trade and capital flows and encourage the development of a vibrant private sector that offers individual African citizens the freedom to expand their economic opportunities and provide for their families;(9) offering the countries of sub-Saharan Africa enhanced trade preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and direct investment in support of the positive economic and political developments under way throughout the region; and(10) encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and investment barriers in Africa will enhance the benefits of trade and investment for the region as well as enhance commercial and political ties between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa.(Pub.

FINDINGS.\u201cThe Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) The African Growth and Opportunity Act [19 U.S.C. 3701\u201c(2) The Act\u2019s eligibility requirements have reinforced democratic values and the rule of law, and have strengthened adherence to internationally recognized worker rights in eligible sub-Saharan African countries.\u201c(3) The Act has helped to bring about substantial increases in foreign investment in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the textile and apparel sectors, where tens of thousands of new jobs have been created.\u201c(4) As a result of the Agreement on Textiles and Apparel of the World Trade Organization, under which quotas maintained by WTO member countries on textile and apparel products end on Jan", "uary 1, 2005\u201c(5) The underdeveloped physical and financial infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa continues to discourage investment in the region.\u201c(6) Regional integration establishes a foundation on which sub-Saharan African countries can coordinate and pursue policies grounded in African interests and history to achieve sustainable development.\u201c(7) Expanded trade because of the Act has improved fundamental economic conditions within sub-Saharan Africa. The Act has helped to create jobs in the poorest region of the world, and most sub-Saharan African countries have sought to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the Act.\u201c(8) Agricultural biotechnology holds promise for helping solve global food security and human health crises in Africa and, according to recent studies, has made contributions to the protection of the environment by reducing the application of pesticides, reducing soil erosion, and creating an environment more hospitable to wildlife.\u201c(9) (A) One of the greatest challenges facing African countries continues to be the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has infected as many as one out of every four people in some countries, creating tremendous social, political, and economic costs. African countries need continued United States financial and technical assistance to combat this epidemic.\u201c(B) More awareness and involvement by governments are necessary. Countries like Uganda, recognizing the threat of HIV/AIDS, have boldly attacked it through a combination of education, public awareness, enhanced medical infrastructure and resources, and greater access to medical treatment. An effective HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment strategy involves all of these steps.\u201c(10) African countries continue to need trade capacity assistance to establish viable economic capacity, a well-grounded rule of law, and efficient government practices.\u201cSEC. 3.

Sense of the Congress regarding comprehensive debt relief for the world\u2019s poorest countries(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) The burden of external debt has become a major impediment to economic growth and poverty reduction in many of the world\u2019s poorest countries.(2) Until recently, the United States Government and other official creditors sought to address this problem by rescheduling loans and in some cases providing limited debt reduction.(3) Despite such efforts, the cumulative debt of many of the world\u2019s poorest countries continued to grow beyond their capacity to repay.(4) In 1997, the Group of Seven, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund adopted the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), a commitment by the international community that all multilateral and bilateral creditors, acting in a coordinated and concerted fashion, would reduce poor country debt to a sustainable level.(5) The HIPC Initiative is currently undergoing reforms to address concerns raised about country conditionality, the amount of debt forgiven, and the allocation of savings realized through the debt forgiveness program to ensure that the Initiative accomplishes the goals of economic growth and pove", "rty alleviation in the world\u2019s poorest countries.(b) Sense of the CongressIt is the sense of the Congress that\u2014(1) Congress and the President should work together, without undue delay and in concert with the international community, to make comprehensive debt relief available to the world\u2019s poorest countries in a manner that promotes economic growth and poverty alleviation;(2) this program of bilateral and multilateral debt relief should be designed to strengthen and expand the private sector, encourage increased trade and investment, support the development of free markets, and promote broad-scale economic growth in beneficiary countries;(3) this program of debt relief should also support the adoption of policies to alleviate poverty and to ensure that benefits are shared widely among the population, such as through initiatives to advance education, improve health, combat AIDS, and promote clean water and environmental protection;(4) these debt relief agreements should be designed and implemented in a transparent manner and with the broad participation of the citizenry of the debtor country and should ensure that country circumstances are adequately taken into account;(5) no country should receive the benefits of debt relief if that country does not cooperate with the United States on terrorism or narcotics enforcement, is a gross violator of the human rights of its citizens, or is engaged in conflict or spends excessively on its military; and(6) in order to prevent adverse impact on a key industry in many developing countries, the International Monetary Fund must mobilize its own resources for providing debt relief to eligible countries without allowing gold to reach the open market, or otherwise adversely affecting the market price of gold.(Pub.

Executive branch initiatives(a) Statement of the CongressThe Congress recognizes that the stated policy of the executive branch in 1997, the \u201cPartnership for Growth and Opportunity in Africa\u201d initiative, is a ", "step toward the establishment of a comprehensive trade and development policy for sub-Saharan Africa. It is the sense of the Congress that this Partnership is a companion to the policy goals set forth in this chapter.(b) Technical assistance to promote economic reforms and developmentIn addition to continuing bilateral and multilateral economic and development assistance, the President shall target technical assistance toward\u2014(1) developing relationships between United States firms and firms in sub-Saharan Africa through a variety of business associations and networks;(2) providing assistance to the governments of sub-Saharan African countries to\u2014(A) liberalize trade and promote exports;(B) bring their legal regimes into compliance with the standards of the World Trade Organization in conjunction with membership in that Organization;(C) make financial and fiscal reforms; and(D) promote greater agribusiness linkages;(3) addressing such critical agricultural policy issues as market liberalization, agricultural export development, and agribusiness investment in processing and transporting agricultural commodities;(4) increasing the number of reverse trade missions to growth-oriented countries in sub-Saharan Africa;(5) increasing trade in services; and(6) encouraging greater sub-Saharan African participation in future negotiations in the World Trade Organization on services and making further commitments in their schedules to the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to encourage the removal of tariff and nontariff barriers.(Pub.

Expansion of the United States and Foreign Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa(a) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service (hereafter in this section referred to as the \u201cCommercial Service\u201d) plays an important role in helping United States businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign countries.(2) During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals providing services in eight countries. By early 1997, that presence had been reduced by half to seven professionals in only four countries.(3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established posts.(4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of coverage does not adequately service the needs of United States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan Africa.(5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater United States export activity in those markets, and s", "imilar encouragement should be provided for countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well.(6) Because market information is not widely available in many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play a significant role in assisting United States businesses in markets in those countries.(b) AppointmentsSubject to the availability of appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2001(1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and(2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in not less than 10 different sub-Saharan African countries.(c) Initiative for sub-Saharan AfricaIn order to encourage the export of United States goods and services to sub-Saharan African countries, the International Trade Administration shall make a special effort to\u2014(1) identify United States goods and services which are the best prospects for export by United States companies to sub-Saharan Africa;(2) identify, where appropriate, tariff and nontariff barriers that are preventing or hindering sales of United States goods and services to, or the operation of United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa;(3) hold discussions with appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan Africa on the matters described in paragraphs (1) and (2) with a view to securing increased market access for United States exporters of goods and services;(4) identify current resource allocations and personnel levels in sub-Saharan Africa for the Commercial Service and consider plans for the deployment of additional resources or personnel to that region; and(5) make available to the public, through printed and electronic means of communication, the information derived pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4) for each of the 4 years after May 18, 2000(Pub.

Donation of air traffic control equipment to eligible sub-Saharan African countries\nIt is the sense of the Congress that, to the extent appropriate, the U", "nited States Government should make every effort to donate to governments of sub-Saharan African countries determined to be eligible under section 3703 of this title(Pub.

Sense of the Congress regarding efforts to combat desertification in Africa and other countries(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) desertification affects approximately one-sixth of the world\u2019s population and one-quarter of the total land area;(2) over 1,000,000 hectares of Africa are affected by desertification;(3) dryland degradation is an underlying cause of recurrent famine in Africa;(4) the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that desertification costs the world $42,000,000,000 a year, not including incalculable costs in human suffering; and(5) the United States can strengthen its partnerships throughout Africa and other countries affected by desertification, help alleviate social and economic crises caused by misuse of natural resources, and reduce dependence on foreign aid, by taking a leading role to combat desertification.(b) Sense of the CongressIt is the sense of the Congress that the United States should expeditiously work with the international community, particularly Africa and other countries affected by desertification, to\u2014(1) strengthen international cooperation to combat desertification;(2) promote the development of national and regional strategies to address desertification and increase public awareness of this serious problem and its effects;(3) develop and implement national action programs that identify the causes of desertification and measures to address it; and(4) recognize the essential role of local governments and nongovernmental organizations in developing and implementing measures to address desertification.(Pub.

Short title and findings(a) Short titleThis chapter may be cited as the \u201cBipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002\u201d.(b) FindingsThe Congress makes the following findings:(1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the national security of the United States. Trade is critical to the economic growth and strength of the United States and to its leadership in the world. Sta", "ble trading relationships promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold War, binding nations together through a series of mutual rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and peace throughout the world.(2) The national security of the United States depends on its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of the economy of the United States, such as information technology, telecommunications and other leading technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, and intellectual property. Trade will create new opportunities for the United States and preserve the unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, political, and military affairs. The United States, secured by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.(3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that dispute settlement procedures under international trade agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in such agreements. Therefore\u2014(A) the recent pattern of decisions by dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body to impose obligations and restrictions on the use of antidumping, countervailing, and safeguard measures by WTO members under the Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards has raised concerns; and(B) the Congress is concerned that dispute settlement panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body appropriately apply the standard of review contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO member of provisions of that Agre", "ement, and to the evaluation by a WTO member of the facts where that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the establishment of the facts is proper.(Pub.

FindingsCongress finds the following:(1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being used by rebels and state actors to finance military activities, overthrow legitimate governments, subvert international efforts to promote peace and stability, and commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians. During the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been driven from their homes by wars waged in large part for control of diamond mining areas. A million of these are refugees eking out a miserable existence in neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have fled to the United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have died during these wars.(2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights violations.(3) Human rights and humanitarian advocates, the diamond trade as represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United States Government have been working to block the trade in conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in conflict diamonds.(4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to address threats to international peace ", "and security posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these actions, it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons to certain countries affected by such conflicts. It has further required all states to prohibit the direct and indirect import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone unless the diamonds are controlled under specified certificate of origin regimes and to prohibit absolutely the direct and indirect import of rough diamonds from Liberia.(5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified certificates of origin and fully prohibiting the importation of rough diamonds from Liberia. The United States is now taking further action against trade in conflict diamonds.(6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat of a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other countries are involved in working, through the \u201cKimberley Process\u201d, toward devising a solution to this problem. As the consumer of a majority of the world\u2019s supply of diamonds, the United States has an obligation to help sever the link between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of an effective solution.(7) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.(8) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the trade in conflict diamonds.(9) The Interlaken Declaration on the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds of November 5, 2002(Pub.
