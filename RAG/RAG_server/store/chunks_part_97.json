No. 13969, Dec. 28, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of Ame", "rica, and in order to ensure the education, health, safety, and well-being of America\u2019s children, our most essential resource upon which the future of our great Nation depends, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPurposeThe prolonged deprivation of in-person learning opportunities has produced undeniably dire consequences for the children of this country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that school attendance is negatively correlated with a child\u2019s risk of depression and various types of abuse. States have seen substantial declines in reports of child maltreatment while school buildings have been closed, indicating that allegations are going unreported. These reductions are driven in part by social isolation from the schoolteachers and support staff with whom students typically interact and who have an obligation to report suspected child maltreatment. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has also found that school closures have a \u201csubstantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and families.\u201d Additionally, a recent survey of educators found student absences from school, including virtual learning, have nearly doubled during the pandemic, and as AAP has noted, chronic absenteeism is associated with alcohol and drug use, teenage pregnancy, juvenile delinquency, and suicide attempts.School closures are especially difficult for families with children with special needs. Schools provide not only academic supports for students with special needs, but they also provide much-needed in-person therapies and services, including physical and occupational therapies. A recent survey found that 80 percent of children with special needs are not receiving the services and supports to which they are entitled and that approximately 40 percent of children with special needs are receiving no services or supports. Moreover, the survey found that virtual learning may not be fully accessible to these students, as children with special needs are twice as likely to receive little or", " no remote learning and to be dissatisfied with the remote learning received.Low-income and minority children are also disproportionately affected by school closures. In low-income zip codes, students\u2019 math progress decreased by nearly 50 percent while school buildings were closed in the spring, and the math progress of students in middle-income zip codes fell by almost a third during the same period. A recent analysis projected that, if in-person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, Hispanic, Black, and low-income students will lose 9.2, 10.3, and 12.4 months of learning, respectively.A failure to quickly resume in-person learning options is likely to have long-term economic effects on children and their families. According to a recent study, if in-person classes do not fully resume until January 2021, the average student could lose $61,000 to $82,000 in lifetime earnings, or the equivalent of a year of full-time work. Additionally, in 2019, more than 90 percent of children under the age of 18 had at least one employed parent. Many employed parents do not have the option of engaging in remote work that allows them the flexibility to supervise their children during the day when in-person learning options are not available. Without the resumption of in-person learning opportunities, the economic and social harms resulting from such lost employment opportunities will continue to compound.To help mitigate these harms, the Department of Health and Human Services recently announced additional relief for low-income parents by allowing States to use funds available through the Child Care and Development Fund to subsidize child care services and services that supplement academic instruction for children under the age of 13 who are participating in virtual instruction. Nevertheless, virtual instruction is an inadequate substitute for in-person learning opportunities and this aid is insufficient to meet current needs.While some families, especially those with financial means, have been able to mitigate school di", "sruptions through in-person options such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, and innovative models like microschools and \u201clearning pods,\u201d for many families, their children\u2019s residentially assigned public school remains their only financially available option. Unfortunately, more than 50 percent of all public-school students in the United States began school remotely this fall. These children, including those with special needs, are being underserved due to the public education system\u2019s failure to provide in-person learning options.Students whose families pay tuition for their education are also facing significant hardships due to the economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Scores of private schools, including approximately 100 Catholic schools, have permanently closed since the onset of COVID\u201319, and more than half of our Nation\u2019s private schools are believed to have lost enrollment due to the pandemic.

Recommendation of candidate sites for site characterization(a) GuidelinesNot later than 180 days after January 7, 1983(b) Recommendation by Secretary to President(1)(A) Following the issuance of guidelines under subsection (a) and consultation with the Governors of affected States, the Secretary shall nominate at least 5 sites that he determines suitable for site characterization for selection of the first repository site.(B) Subsequent to such nomination, the Secretary shall recommend to the President 3 of the nominated sites not later than January 1, 1985(C) Such recommendations under subparagraph (B) shall be consistent with the provisions of section 10225 of this title(D) Each nomination of a site under this subsection shall be accompanied by an environmental assessment, which shall include a detailed statement of the basis for such recommendation and of the probable impacts of the site characterization activities planned for such site, and a discussion of alternative activities relating to site characterization that may be undertaken to avoid such impacts. Such environmental assessment shall include\u2014(i) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is suitable for site characterization under the guidelines established under subsection (a);(ii) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is suitable for development as a repository under each such guideline that does not require site characterization as a prerequisite for application of such guideline;(iii) an evaluation by the Secretary of the effects of the site characterization activities at such site on the public health and safety and the environment;(iv) a reasonable comparative evaluation by the Secretary of such site wi", "th other sites and locations that have been considered;(v) a description of the decision process by which such site was recommended; and(vi) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating the proposed repository at such site.(E)(i)\u202f11section 10139 of this title22(F) Each environmental assessment prepared under this paragraph shall be made available to the public.(G) Before nominating a site, the Secretary shall notify the Governor and legislature of the State in which such site is located, or the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such site is located, as the case may be, of such nomination and the basis for such nomination.(2) Before nominating any site the Secretary shall hold public hearings in the vicinity of such site to inform the residents of the area in which such site is located of the proposed nomination of such site and to receive their comments. At such hearings, the Secretary shall also solicit and receive any recommendations of such residents with respect to issues that should be addressed in the environmental assessment described in paragraph (1) and the site characterization plan described in section 10133(b)(1) of this title(3) In evaluating the sites nominated under this section prior to any decision to recommend a site as a candidate site, the Secretary shall use available geophysical, geologic, geochemical and hydrologic, and other information and shall not conduct any preliminary borings or excavations at a site unless (i) such preliminary boring or excavation activities were in progress on January 7, 1983Provided(c) Presidential review of recommended candidate sites(1) The President shall review each candidate site recommendation made by the Secretary under subsection (b). Not later than 60 days after the submission by the Secretary of a recommendation of a candidate site, the President, in his discretion, may either approve or disapprove such candidate site, and shall transmit any such decision to the Secretary and to either the Governor and legislature of the St", "ate in which such candidate site is located, or the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such candidate site is located, as the case may be. If, during such 60-day period, the President fails to approve or disapprove such candidate site, or fails to invoke his authority under paragraph (2) to delay his decision, such candidate site shall be considered to be approved, and the Secretary shall notify such Governor and legislature, or governing body of the affected Indian tribe, of the approval of such candidate site by reason of the inaction of the President.(2) The President may delay for not more than 6 months his decision under paragraph (1) to approve or disapprove a candidate site, upon determining that the information provided with the recommendation of the Secretary is insufficient to permit a decision within the 60-day period referred to in paragraph (1). The President may invoke his authority under this paragraph by submitting written notice to the Congress, within such 60-day period, of his intent to invoke such authority. If the President invokes such authority, but fails to approve or disapprove the candidate site involved by the end of such 6-month period, such candidate site shall be considered to be approved, and the Secretary shall notify such Governor and legislature, or governing body of the affected Indian tribe, of the approval of such candidate site by reason of the inaction of the President.(d) Preliminary activitiesExcept as otherwise provided in this section, each activity of the President or the Secretary under this section shall be considered to be a preliminary decisionmaking activity.

FindingsThe Congress finds that:(1) Native Hawaiians comprise a distinct and unique indigenous people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago whose society was organized as a Nation prior to the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in 1778.(2) The Native Hawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory, and their cultural identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions.(3) The constitution and statutes of the State of Hawaii:(A) acknowledge the distinct land rights of Native Hawaiian people as beneficiaries of the public lands trust; and(B) reaffirm and protect the unique right of the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their cultural and religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language.(4) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistence social system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.(5) A unified monarchical government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawaii.(6) Throughout the 19th century and until 1893, the United States: (A) recognized the independence of the Hawaiian Nation; (B) extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government; and (C) entered into treaties and conv", "entions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875 and 1887.(7) In the year 1893, the United States Minister assigned to the sovereign and independent Kingdom of Hawaii, John L. Stevens, conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the Kingdom, including citizens of the United States, to overthrow the indigenous and lawful Government of Hawaii.(8) In pursuance of that conspiracy, the United States Minister and the naval representative of the United States caused armed naval forces of the United States to invade the sovereign Hawaiian Nation in support of the overthrow of the indigenous and lawful Government of Hawaii and the United States Minister thereupon extended diplomatic recognition of a provisional government formed by the conspirators without the consent of the native people of Hawaii or the lawful Government of Hawaii in violation of treaties between the two nations and of international law.(9) In a message to Congress on December 18, 1893(10) Queen Lili\u2019uokalani, the lawful monarch of Hawaii, and the Hawaiian Patriotic League, representing the aboriginal citizens of Hawaii, promptly petitioned the United States for redress of these wrongs and for restoration of the indigenous government of the Hawaiian nation, but this petition was not acted upon.(11) In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii through the Newlands Resolution without the consent of or compensation to the indigenous people of Hawaii or their sovereign government who were thereby denied the mechanism for expression of their inherent sovereignty through self-government and self-determination, their lands and ocean resources.(12) Through the Newlands Resolution and the 1900 Organic Act, the United States Congress received 1.75 million acres of lands formerly owned by the Crown and Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom and exempted the lands from then existing public land laws of the United States by mandating that the revenue and proceeds from these lands be \u201cused solely for the benefit of", " the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for education and other public purposes\u201d, thereby establishing a special trust relationship between the United States and the inhabitants of Hawaii.(13) In 1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 which designated 200,000 acres of the ceded public lands for exclusive homesteading by Native Hawaiians, thereby affirming the trust relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians, as expressed by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane who was cited in the Committee Report of the United States House of Representatives Committee on Territories as stating, \u201cOne thing that impressed me .\u2000.\u2000. was the fact that the natives of the islands who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.\u201d.(14) In 1938, the United States Congress again acknowledged the unique status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 20, 193852 Stat. 781(15) Under the Act entitled \u201cAn Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union\u201d, approved March 18, 195973 Stat. 4(16) Under the Act entitled \u201cAn Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union\u201d, approved March 18, 195973 Stat. 4March 18, 195973 Stat. 4(17) The authority of the Congress under the United States Constitution to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or indigenous peoples of the United States includes the authority to legislate in matters affecting the native peoples of Alaska and Hawaii.(18) In furtherance of the trust responsibility for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, the United States has established a program for the provision of comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention services to maintain and improve the health status of the Hawaiian people.(19) This historical and unique legal relationship has been consistently recognized and affirmed by the Congress through the enactment of Federal laws which extend to th", "e Hawaiian people the same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities, including the Native American Programs Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C. 299142 U.S.C. 199620 U.S.C. 80q25 U.S.C. 3001(20) The United States has also recognized and reaffirmed the trust relationship to the Hawaiian people through legislation which authorizes the provision of services to Native Hawaiians, specifically, the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 300129 U.S.C. 701(21) The United States has also affirmed the historical and unique legal relationship to the Hawaiian people by authorizing the provision of services to Native Hawaiians to address problems of alcohol and drug abuse under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.(22) Despite such services, the unmet health needs of the Native Hawaiian people are severe and the health status of Native Hawaiians continues to be far below that of the general population of the United States.(Pub.

Findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) physical or mental disabilities in no way diminish a person\u2019s right to fully participate in all aspects of society, yet many people with physical or mental disabilities have been precluded from doing so because of discrimination; others who have a record of a disability or are regarded as having a disability also have been subjected to discrimination;(2) historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem;(3) discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critic", "al areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services;(4) unlike individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination;(5) individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities;(6) census data, national polls, and other studies have documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally;(7) the Nation\u2019s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and(8) the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous, and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity.(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this chapter\u2014(1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;(2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilitie", "s;(3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities; and(4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.(Pub.

L. 110\u2013325, \u00a7\u202f2Sept. 25, 2008122 Stat. 3553\n\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds that\u2014\u201c(1) in enacting the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) [42 U.S.C. 12101\u201c(2) in enacting the ADA, Congress recognized that physical and mental disabilities in no way diminish a person\u2019s right to fully participate in all aspects of society, but that people with physical or mental disabilities are frequently precluded from doing so because of prejudice, antiquated attitudes, or the failure to remove societal and institutional barriers;\u201c(3) while Congress expected that the definition of disability under the ADA would be interpreted consistently with ", "how courts had applied the definition of a handicapped individual under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 701\u201c(4) the holdings of the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases have narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA, thus eliminating protection for many individuals whom Congress intended to protect;\u201c(5) the holding of the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) further narrowed the broad scope of protection intended to be afforded by the ADA;\u201c(6) as a result of these Supreme Court cases, lower courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with disabilities;\u201c(7) in particular, the Supreme Court, in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), interpreted the term \u2018substantially limits\u2019 to require a greater degree of limitation than was intended by Congress; and\u201c(8) Congress finds that the current Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ADA regulations defining the term \u2018substantially limits\u2019 as \u2018significantly restricted\u2019 are inconsistent with congressional intent, by expressing too high a standard.\u201c(b) PurposesThe purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2008 Amendment note above] are\u2014\u201c(1) to carry out the ADA\u2019s objectives of providing \u2018a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination\u2019 and \u2018clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination\u2019 by reinstating a broad scope of protection to be available under the ADA;\u201c(2) to reject the requirement enunciated by the Supreme Court in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures;\u201c(3) to reject the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc", "., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) with regard to coverage under the third prong of the definition of disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;\u201c(4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms \u2018substantially\u2019 and \u2018major\u2019 in the definition of disability under the ADA \u2018need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled,\u2019 and that to be substantially limited in performing a major life activity under the ADA \u2018an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people\u2019s daily lives\u2019;\u201c(5) to convey congressional intent that the standard created by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) for \u2018substantially limits\u2019, and applied by lower courts in numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA, to convey that it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations, and to convey that the question of whether an individual\u2019s impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis; and\u201c(6) to express Congress\u2019 expectation that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will revise that portion of its current regulations that defines the term \u2018substantially limits\u2019 as \u2018significantly restricted\u2019 to be consistent with this Act, including the amendments made by this Act.\u201dStudy by General Accounting Office of Existing Disability-Related Employment IncentivesPub.

Bush.\nExpanding National Service Through Partnerships To Advance Government PrioritiesMemorandum of President of the United States, July 15, 2013Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesService has always been integral to the American identity. Our country was built on the belief that all of us, working together, can make this country a better place for all. That spirit remains as strong and integral to our identity today as at our country\u2019s founding.Since its creation 20 years ago, the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) has been the Federal agency charged with leading and expanding national service. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act of 2009 (SAA) expanded CNCS\u2019s authority to create opportunities for more Americans to serve. This landmark, bipartisan legislation focuses national service on six areas: emergency and disaster services; economic opportunity; education; environmental stewardship; healthy futures; and veterans and military families. The SAA provides greater opportunities for CNCS to partner with other executive departments and agencies (agencies) and with the private sector to utilize national service to address these critical areas.National service and volunteering can be effective solutions to national challenges and can have positive and lasting impacts that reach beyond the immediate service experience. Americans engaged in national service make an intensive commitment to tackle unmet national and local ne", "eds by working through non-profit, faith-based, and community organizations. Service can help Americans gain valuable skills, pursue higher education, and jumpstart their careers, which can provide immediate and long-term benefits to those individuals, as well as the communities in which they serve.Americans are ready and willing to serve. Applications from Americans seeking to engage in national service programs far exceed the number of available positions. By creating new partnerships between agencies and CNCS that expand national service opportunities in areas aligned with agency missions, we can utilize the American spirit of service to improve lives and communities, expand economic and educational opportunities, enhance agencies\u2019 capacity to achieve their missions, efficiently use tax dollars, help individuals develop skills that will enable them to prepare for long-term careers, and build a pipeline to employment inside and outside the Federal Government.Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to expand the positive impact of national service, I hereby direct the following:SectionEstablishing a Task Force on Expanding National Service(a) the Department of Defense;(b) the Department of Justice;(c) the Department of the Interior;(d) the Department of Agriculture;(e) the Department of Commerce;(f) the Department of Labor;(g) the Department of Health and Human Services;(h) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;(i) the Department of Transportation;(j) the Department of Energy;(k) the Department of Education;(l) the Department of Veterans Affairs;(m) the Department of Homeland Security;(n) the Peace Corps;(o) the National Science Foundation;(p) the Office of Personnel Management;(q) the Environmental Protection Agency;(r) the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs; and(s) such other agencies and offices as the co-chairs may designate.SecMission and Function of the Task Force(i) identify existing, and, if appropri", "ate, recommend new, policies or practices that support the expansion of national service and volunteer opportunities that align with the SAA and agency priorities;(ii) make recommendations on the most effective way to coordinate national service and volunteering programs across the Federal Government;(iii) identify and develop opportunities for interagency agreements between CNCS and other agencies to support the expansion of national service and volunteering;(iv) identify and develop public-private partnerships to support the expansion of national service and volunteering;(v) identify and develop strategies to use innovation and technology to facilitate the ability of the public to participate in national service and volunteering activities; and(vi) develop a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of national service and volunteering interventions in achieving agency priorities, and aggregate and disseminate the results of that evaluation.(b) Within 18 months of the date of this memorandum, the Task Force shall provide the President with a report on the progress made with respect to the functions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.SecFacilitating National Service and Volunteering Partnerships(i) within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, consult with CNCS about how existing authorities and CNCS programs can be used to enter into interagency and public-private partnerships that allow for meaningful national service and volunteering opportunities, including participating in AmeriCorps, and help the agency achieve its mission;(ii) work with CNCS to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such partnerships; and(iii) work with CNCS to identify ways in which the agency\u2019s national service participants and volunteers can develop transferable skills, and also how national service can serve as a pipeline to employment inside and outside the Federal Government.(b) Where practicable, agencies may consider entering into interagency agreements with CNCS to share program devel", "opment and funding responsibilities, as authorized under 42 U.S.C. 12571(b)(1)SecRecruitment of National Service Participants in the Civilian Career ServicesSecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(d) The Chief Executive Officer of CNCS is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f12511.
