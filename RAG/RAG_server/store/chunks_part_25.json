Examples of international meetings concerned with matters affecting the Coast Guard include those which dealt with the International Rules of the Road, international load lines, the International Code of Signals, safety at sea, and international telecommunications. It is highly desirable that there be a clear-cut legislative expression of Coast Guard cooperation with the State Department on proposed international conferences dealing with various phases of Coast Guard activities, such as aids to navigation, life-saving equipment, navigation and communication equipment other than radio communication, regulation of dangerous cargoes, international rules of the road, safety requirements and equipment o", "f transoceanic aircraft and vessels, and safe manning standards and efficiency of personnel employed on transoceanic aircraft and vessels.

It would not permit any cooperation that has not been carried on in the past.Although the Coast Guard has always cooperated closely with the Weather Bureau, positive recognition of this has never appeared in the statutes. In its patrol, its aiding navigation, and its life saving activities, the Coast Guard finds it important to make, receive and transmit weather observations and measurements. Furthermore, with the advent of war, weather reporting, particularly mid-Atlantic weather patrol work, assumed increasing importance, and this extensive weather station manning in cooperation with the Weather Bureau must be provided for in the postwar period. This sectio", "n providing for such close cooperation with the Weather Bureau in weather reporting would crystallize the cooperative practices of the two agencies as they have operated for years. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesPrior ProvisionsA prior section 707 was renumbered section 3707 of this titleAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

This is largely the result of duties in connection with inspection of merchant vessels.This section authorizes the designation, with the consent of the State Department, of Coast Guard officers to be officially attached to diplomatic missions of the United States. Although Coast Guard advice on Coast Guard matters is always available to our diplomatic missions, in those locations where such advice and information are frequently sought, it is felt that the most effective utilization of Coast Guard services would be achieved by having Coast Guard officers attached to such missions.

It grants similar authority to the Secretary of the Treasury in relation to vessels in the Coast Guard service, and the limiting amount is reduced from $1,000,000 to $25,000. It is believed that this section will work to the benefit of the Government by reducing civil litigation and the number of claims which must presently be certified to Congress for appropriations in order to make settlement. It will greatly expedite the settlement of just claims and should result in a considerable overall savings to the Government. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesAmendments2021\u2014Subsec.

All such payments shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. The Secretary is further authorized to execute on behalf of the United States and to deliver in exchange for such payment a full release of such claim. This section, as respects the determination, compromise, settlement, and payment of claims, shall be supplementary to, and not in lieu of, all other provisions of law authorizing the determination, compromise, or settlement of claims for damage to property hereinabove described.

Accounting for industrial work(a) In GeneralThe Secretary may prescribe regulations governing accounting for industrial work, including charges for overhead for civilian labor and for maintenance of industrial plant and equipment, performed at the Coast Guard Yard or such similar Coast Guard industrial establishments as he may designate. Any orders placed for such industrial work shall be covered by a transfer or advance of funds to cover the estimated cost thereof, and shall be credited to such accounts as may be necessary and established by the Secretary to carry out the provisions of this section. Accounts so established shall be available for materials, supplies, or equipment, and civilian labor, including overhead and maintenance, required in performing the work ordered. Upon completion of an order an adjustment will be made to make the amount transferred or advanced equal to the actual cost as computed in accordance with the accounting regulations prescribed by the Secretary or in accordance with subsection (b).(b) Incentive Contracts.\u2014(1) The parties to an order for industrial work to be performed by the Coast Guard Yard or a Coast Guard industrial establishment designated under subsection (a) may enter into an order or a cost-plus-incentive-fee order in accordance with this subsection.(2) If such parties enter into such an order or a cost-plus-in", "centive-fee order, an agreed-upon amount of any adjustment described in subsection (a) may be distributed as an incentive to the wage-grade industrial employees who complete the order.(3) Before entering into such an order or cost-plus-incentive-fee order such parties must agree that the wage-grade employees of the Coast Guard Yard or Coast Guard industrial establishment will take action to improve the delivery schedule or technical performance agreed to in the order for industrial work to which such parties initially agreed.(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the industrial workforce of the Coast Guard Yard or Coast Guard industrial establishment satisfies the performance target established in such an order or cost-plus-incentive-fee order\u2014(A) the adjustment to be made pursuant to subsection (a) shall be reduced by an agreed-upon amount and distributed to such wage-grade industrial employees; and(B) the remainder of the adjustment shall be credited to the appropriation for such order current at that time.(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 39363 Stat. 549Pub.

Under existing law several accounts must be kept current for each job in progress. Under this statute the working fund would be available for all types of expenditures in connection with a job and the breakdown into separate accounts could be done after the job is complete. The other armed forces have provisions of law which permit a working fund similar to the one provided by this section. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

The Secretary may prescribe regulations for designating the classification of materials to be stocked. In these regulations, whenever the fund is extended to include items not previously stocked, or spare parts obtained as part of a procurement under a different account of major items such as vessels or aircraft, whether or not such parts were previously stocked, the Secretary may authorize an increase in the existing capital of the fund by the value of such usable materials transferred thereto from Coast Guard inventories carried in other accounts. Except for the materials so transferred, the fund shall be charged with the cost of materials purchased or otherwise acquired. The fund shall be credited with the value of materials consumed, issued for use, sold, or otherwise disposed of, such values to be determined on a basis that will approximately cover the cost thereof.(b) Obligations may, without regard to fiscal year limitations, be incurred against anticipated reimbursement to the Coast Guard Supply Fund in such amount and for such period, as the Secretary, with approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, may determine to be necessary to maintain stock levels consistently with planned operations for the next year.(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 39363 Stat. 550Aug. 7, 1956, ch. 1023, \u00a7\u202f1(a)70 Stat. 1077Pub.

It makes statutory what has been administrative regulation heretofore, and it is believed highly desirable to make the control of an institution of such national interest as the Academy the subject of a statute.This section is new. There is no provision in existing law which establishes the Academy and sets it up as an operating unit. Nor is there any provision which creates the office of Superintendent of the Academy, or prescribes his duties and functions. Heretofore this has been accomplished by regulations, and the laws which deal with the Academy assume its existence as a going institution and assume the existence of the Superintendent with certain defined functions and duties. This section continues the Academy as previously established, provides for the appointment of the Superintendent by the Commandant, and defines in general terms his functions. The Academy would thus be placed on a definite statutory basis, and the office of Superintendent would be a statutory position, but the present administration of the Academy would in no way be interfered with. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

The work load of an instructor varies grea", "tly, and flexibility in administration of a faculty is therefore essential. The leave provided for civil service employees does not fit the needs of an instruction staff, and this has been a source of difficulty in the past.

The scope of duty of members of the staff is enlarged to include whatever the Commandant prescribes.Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f15b provides for five professors as heads or assistant heads of departments at the Academy. The Academic Board of the Academy and the Advisory Committee, after extensive study have recommended the change, as provided in this section, to three professors and twelve others on the permanent teaching ", "staff, with designations to conform generally with the designations and grades of faculty members at other universities. The librarian is given faculty status because of the role of the library as the center of the modern university; this is in conformity with the practice of other higher educational institutions. It is believed that the increased number of permanent commissioned instructors is justified and desirable in view of the expansion of the Cadet Corps as the full effect of the return to a four-year course is felt. It is probable that, in the next few years, the number of cadets will approximate 450. The average number in the past two years has been about 300. This new set-up for the permanent commissioned teaching staff will permit desirable exchanges of professors with leading universities, and occasional sabbatical leaves in order to better the faculty generally. It is pointed out that this increase in permanent instructors does not increase the authorized number of officers in the Coast Guard, as they are all included in the limitation provided in section 42 of this titleEditorial NotesAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

An original appointment to the permanent commissioned teaching staff, unless the appointee has served as a civilian member of the teaching staff, regular commissioned officer, temporary commissioned officer, or reserve commissioned officer in the Coast Guard, shall be a temporary appointment until the appointee has satisfactorily completed a probationary term of four years of service; thereafter he may be regularly appointed and his rank shall date from the date of his temporary appointment in the grade in which permanently appointed.(Aug.

Authorization for appointment in any grade is deemed desirable in order to permit the acquisition of outstanding instructors for the staff.

It is believed desirable to include such a provision to prevent any misconstruction of retirement statutes, even though no change in existing law is intended on the point covered, either by other sections dealing with retirement or by this section.Subsection (b) is a codification of the only provision of title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f174, that it is desired to retain, and in addition designated the next higher grade for commissioned warrant officers as lieutenant (junior grade) because the pay of the commissioned warrant officers is the same as for the grade of lieutenant (junior grade) and advancing such officers to the grade of ensign would in some aspects not appear to be a promotion. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

G, title LVXXXVJan. 1, 2021134 Stat. 4749\nHistorical and Revision NotesBased on title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u00a7\u202f193, 194, 195, 196 (June 20, 1874, ch. 344, \u00a7\u202f718 Stat. 127June 18, 1878, ch. 265, \u00a7\u202f1220 Stat. 165May 4, 1882, ch. 117, \u00a7\u202f922 Stat. 57Jan. 21, 1897, ch. 8329 Stat. 494Said sections have been rewritten so as to make the awarding of Life-saving medals turn on whether or not the United States has an interest in the he", "roic act, rather than on technical jurisdictional grounds. Under existing law the award of a medal could be made in any case in which the rescuer or the rescued was a citizen of the United States, or was from a vessel owned or operated by the United States regardless of where the rescue took place; and if the rescue took place within waters of the United States the award could be made to an alien.The existing law relating to the Treasury Department Life-Saving Medal contained in title 14, U.S.C., 1946, ed., \u00a7\u00a7\u202f192\u2013196, has long needed revision. The existing law is composed of a series of statutes enacted separately between 1874 and 1897, and the result has not been entirely unsatisfactory. The original statute, enacted in 1874 (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f193), provided for Life-saving medals of the first and second class to be bestowed \u201cupon any persons who shall hereafter endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from the perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel\u201d. The medal of the first class was confined to cases of \u201cextreme and heroic daring\u201d and the medal of the second class was to be awarded \u201cin cases not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the medal of the first class\u201d Then in 1878 another act was passed (title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f194) authorizing the bestowal of the medal of the second class \u201cupon persons making such signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked, and saving persons from drowning\u201d as, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, merited recognition. These two sections were construed by the Attorney General to be limited to the rescue of persons who were subjected to the perils of the sea in any waters of the United States in the vicinity of any lifeboat station, life-saving station, or house of refuge. And the person upon whom the medal could be bestowed was limited to members of life-saving crews. (1895) Op. Att. Gen. 124. Thereupon, in 1897, an act was passed which provided that the two earlier acts should \u201cb", "e construed so as to empower the Secretary of the Treasury to bestow such medals upon persons making signal exertions in rescuing and succoring the shipwrecked and saving persons from drowning in waters over which the United States has jurisdiction, whether the said persons making such exertions were or were not members of the Life-Saving Service or whether or not such exertions were made in the vicinity of a life-saving station\u201d. (Title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f196.) This act was designed to give a more liberal application to the two earlier acts, and all three were to be read as one. (1900) 23 Op. Atty. Gen. 78. However, difficult questions of interpretation have arisen because of the different jurisdictional language in the three acts. For example, title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f193, refers to rescues \u201cwithin the United States\u201d, while title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f196, refers to rescues \u201cin the waters over which the United States has jurisdiction\u201d. The need for clarification is obvious. Subsection (a) authorizes the awarding of the medal to any person, including Coast Guard personnel, who rescues or endeavors to rescue any person from drowning, shipwreck, or peril of the water. If the rescue or attempted rescue is at the risk of one\u2019s own life and evidences extreme and heroic daring, the medal shall be of gold, and if the rescue or attempted rescue is not sufficiently distinguished to deserve the gold medal, but evidences the exertion of such signal exertion as to merit recognition, the medal shall be of silver. Thus, the acts for which the medals are to be awarded are defined simply and without any geographical or jurisdictional limitations. The difficulty with the existing law is the attempt to define the required deed together with those limitations. Subsection (a) does not change existing law insofar as the type of act necessary for the medals is concerned; it merely simplifies and clarifies existing law.Subsection (b) contains the jurisdictional limitations on the awarding of the medal and broadens, to a co", "nsiderable extent, the provisions of existing law. It is the intent of this subsection to authorize the awarding of a medal in all cases where the United States has a legitimate interest in recognizing meritorious acts, such as where a United States citizen performs the act, or where a United States citizen is rescued, or where United States waters or United States vessels or aircraft are involved. Accordingly, rescues by United States citizens anywhere in the world will be recognized. Any person, including persons not citizens of the United States, may receive medals if the rescue or attempted rescue takes place in waters within the United States or subject to its jurisdiction or, in cases of rescues outside such waters, if either the rescuer or the person rescued is from a United States vessel or aircraft, or the person rescued is a United States citizen. Thus, every case in which the United States government has an interest is provided for. A United States citizen who performs a heroic act sufficient to justify a medal in state waters, or in foreign waters, could not receive one under existing law, but could receive such award under this proposed revision. The awarding of medals should not turn on technical jurisdictional grounds; it should turn rather on the interest of the United States to recognize noble and heroic acts.Subsection (c) dealing with the awarding of bars for additional acts, clarifies, but does not change title 14, U.S.C., 1946 ed., \u00a7\u202f195, except that authority is granted to award medals posthumously. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesAmendments2021\u2014Subsec.

It seems that this is the most feasible method of insuring that the pay of military personnel of the Coast Guard will not vary from the pay of military personnel of the other armed forces. The assimilation is intended to include authorization for extra pay and allowances as provided for personnel of the Navy, for all types of special duty: for example, qualified divers on diving duty, military personnel assigned to submarine duty, military personnel assigned to aviation duty, officers assigned as aides to flag officers, and enlisted persons assigned to duty in the mess detail.

L. 103\u2013382September 30, 1997Executive Documents\nEx. Ord. No. 14036. Promoting Competition in the American EconomyEx. Ord. No. 14036, July 9, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitut", "ion and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote the interests of American workers, businesses, and consumers, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyThe American promise of a broad and sustained prosperity depends on an open and competitive economy. For workers, a competitive marketplace creates more high-quality jobs and the economic freedom to switch jobs or negotiate a higher wage. For small businesses and farmers, it creates more choices among suppliers and major buyers, leading to more take-home income, which they can reinvest in their enterprises. For entrepreneurs, it provides space to experiment, innovate, and pursue the new ideas that have for centuries powered the American economy and improved our quality of life. And for consumers, it means more choices, better service, and lower prices.Robust competition is critical to preserving America\u2019s role as the world\u2019s leading economy.Yet over the last several decades, as industries have consolidated, competition has weakened in too many markets, denying Americans the benefits of an open economy and widening racial, income, and wealth inequality. Federal Government inaction has contributed to these problems, with workers, farmers, small businesses, and consumers paying the price.Consolidation has increased the power of corporate employers, making it harder for workers to bargain for higher wages and better work conditions. Powerful companies require workers to sign non-compete agreements that restrict their ability to change jobs. And, while many occupational licenses are critical to increasing wages for workers and especially workers of color, some overly restrictive occupational licensing requirements can impede workers\u2019 ability to find jobs and to move between States.Consolidation in the agricultural industry is making it too hard for small family farms to survive. Farmers are squeezed between concentrated market power in the agricultural input industries\u2014seed, fertilizer, feed, and equipment suppliers\u2014and concentrated market ", "power in the channels for selling agricultural products. As a result, farmers\u2019 share of the value of their agricultural products has decreased, and poultry farmers, hog farmers, cattle ranchers, and other agricultural workers struggle to retain autonomy and to make sustainable returns.The American information technology sector has long been an engine of innovation and growth, but today a small number of dominant internet platforms use their power to exclude market entrants, to extract monopoly profits, and to gather intimate personal information that they can exploit for their own advantage. Too many small businesses across the economy depend on those platforms and a few online marketplaces for their survival. And too many local newspapers have shuttered or downsized, in part due to the internet platforms\u2019 dominance in advertising markets.Americans are paying too much for prescription drugs and healthcare services\u2014far more than the prices paid in other countries. Hospital consolidation has left many areas, particularly rural communities, with inadequate or more expensive healthcare options. And too often, patent and other laws have been misused to inhibit or delay\u2014for years and even decades\u2014competition from generic drugs and biosimilars, denying Americans access to lower-cost drugs.In the telecommunications sector, Americans likewise pay too much for broadband, cable television, and other communications services, in part because of a lack of adequate competition. In the financial-services sector, consumers pay steep and often hidden fees because of industry consolidation. Similarly, the global container shipping industry has consolidated into a small number of dominant foreign-owned lines and alliances, which can disadvantage American exporters.The problem of economic consolidation now spans these sectors and many others, endangering our ability to rebuild and emerge from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201319) pandemic with a vibrant, innovative, and growing economy. Meanwhile, the United States faces new challe", "nges to its economic standing in the world, including unfair competitive pressures from foreign monopolies and firms that are state-owned or state-sponsored, or whose market power is directly supported by foreign governments.We must act now to reverse these dangerous trends, which constrain the growth and dynamism of our economy, impair the creation of high-quality jobs, and threaten America\u2019s economic standing in the world.This order affirms that it is the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and monopsony\u2014especially as these issues arise in labor markets, agricultural markets, Internet platform industries, healthcare markets (including insurance, hospital, and prescription drug markets), repair markets, and United States markets directly affected by foreign cartel activity.It is also the policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to meet the challenges posed by new industries and technologies, including the rise of the dominant Internet platforms, especially as they stem from serial mergers, the acquisition of nascent competitors, the aggregation of data, unfair competition in attention markets, the surveillance of users, and the presence of network effects.Whereas decades of industry consolidation have often led to excessive market concentration, this order reaffirms that the United States retains the authority to challenge transactions whose previous consummation was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (26 Stat. 20915 U.S.C. 1et seqPublic Law 63\u201321238 Stat. 73015 U.S.C. 12et seqSee15 U.S.C. 18Standard Oil Co. v. United StatesThis order reasserts as United States policy that the answer to the rising power of foreign monopolies and cartels is not the tolerance of domestic monopolization, but rather the promotion of competition and innovation by firms small and large, at home and worldwide.It is also the policy of my Administration to support aggressive legi", "slative reforms that would lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and through other related reforms. It is further the policy of my Administration to support the enactment of a public health insurance option.My Administration further reaffirms the policy stated in Executive Order 13725 of April 15, 20165 U.S.C. 601Public Law 67\u20135142 Stat. 1597 U.S.C. 181et seqPublic Law 81\u201389964 Stat. 1125Public Law 86\u201346374 Stat. 12912 U.S.C. 1828Public Law 104\u2013104110 Stat. 56Sec.The Statutory Basis of a Whole-of-Government Competition PolicyPublic Law 63\u201320338 Stat. 71715 U.S.C. 41et seq(b) The antitrust laws reflect an underlying policy favoring competition that transcends those particular enactments. As the Supreme Court has stated, for instance, the Sherman Act \u201crests on the premise that the unrestrained interaction of competitive forces will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conducive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.\u201d Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States(c) Consistent with these broader policies, and in addition to the traditional antitrust laws, the Congress has also enacted industry-specific fair competition and anti-monopolization laws that often provide additional protections. Such enactments include the Packers and Stockyards Act, the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (Public Law 74\u201340149 Stat. 97727 U.S.C. 201et seqPublic Law 98\u201341798 Stat. 1585Public Law 98\u201323798 Stat. 6746 U.S.C. 40101et seqPublic Law 104\u201388109 Stat. 803Public Law 108\u2013164117 Stat. 202415 U.S.C. 7601et seqPublic Law 111\u2013203124 Stat. 1376(d) These statutes independently charge a number of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to protect conditions of fair competition in one or more ways, including by:(i) policing unfair, deceptive, and abusive business practices;(ii) resisting consolid", "ation and promoting competition within industries through the independent oversight of mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures;(iii) promulgating rules that promote competition, including the market entry of new competitors; and(iv) promoting market transparency through compelled disclosure of information.(e) The agencies that administer such or similar authorities include the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Transportation, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Maritime Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Surface Transportation Board.(f) Agencies can influence the conditions of competition through their exercise of regulatory authority or through the procurement process. See41 U.S.C. 1705(g) This order recognizes that a whole-of-government approach is necessary to address overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition in the American economy. Such an approach is supported by existing statutory mandates. Agencies can and should further the polices set forth in section 1 of this order by, among other things, adopting pro-competitive regulations and approaches to procurement and spending, and by rescinding regulations that create unnecessary barriers to entry that stifle competition.Sec.Agency Cooperation in Oversight, Investigation, and Remedies(b) Where there is overlapping jurisdiction over particular cases, conduct, transactions, or industries, agencies are encouraged to coordinate their efforts, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, with respect to:(i) the investigation of conduct potentially harmful to competition;(ii) the oversight of proposed mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures; and(iii) the design, execution, and oversight", " of remedies.(c) The means of cooperation in cases of overlapping jurisdiction should include, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law:(i) sharing relevant information and industry data;(ii) in the case of major transactions, soliciting and giving significant consideration to the views of the Attorney General or the Chair of the FTC, as applicable; and(iii) cooperating with any concurrent Department of Justice or FTC oversight activities under the Sherman Act or Clayton Act.(d) Nothing in subsections (a) through (c) of this section shall be construed to suggest that the statutory standard applied by an agency, or its independent assessment under that standard, should be displaced or substituted by the judgment of the Attorney General or the Chair of the FTC. When their views are solicited, the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to provide a response to the agency in time for the agency to consider it in advance of any statutory deadline for agency action.Sec.The White House Competition Council(b) The Council shall coordinate, promote, and advance Federal Government efforts to address overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition in or directly affecting the American economy, including efforts to:(i) implement the administrative actions identified in this order;(ii) develop procedures and best practices for agency cooperation and coordination on matters of overlapping jurisdiction, as described in section 3 of this order;(iii) identify and advance any additional administrative actions necessary to further the policies set forth in section 1 of this order; and(iv) identify any potential legislative changes necessary to further the policies set forth in section 1 of this order.(c) The Council shall work across agencies to provide a coordinated response to overconcentration, monopolization, and unfair competition in or directly affecting the American economy. The Council shall also work with each agency to ensure that agency operations are conducted in a manner that promote", "s fair competition, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.(d) The Council shall not discuss any current or anticipated enforcement actions.(e) The Council shall be led by the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council, who shall serve as Chair of the Council.(f) In addition to the Chair, the Council shall consist of the following members:(i) the Secretary of the Treasury;(ii) the Secretary of Defense;(iii) the Attorney General;(iv) the Secretary of Agriculture;(v) the Secretary of Commerce;(vi) the Secretary of Labor;(vii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;(viii) the Secretary of Transportation;(ix) the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs;

and(ii) the potential for their procurement or other spending to improve the competitiveness of small businesses and businesses with fair labor practices.(b) The Attorney General, the Chair of the FTC, and the heads of other agencies with authority to enforce the Clayton Act are encouraged to enforce the antitrust laws fai", "rly and vigorously.(c) To address the consolidation of industry in many markets across the economy, as described in section 1 of this order, the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to review the horizontal and vertical merger guidelines and consider whether to revise those guidelines.(d) To avoid the potential for anticompetitive extension of market power beyond the scope of granted patents, and to protect standard-setting processes from abuse, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce are encouraged to consider whether to revise their position on the intersection of the intellectual property and antitrust laws, including by considering whether to revise the Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND Commitments issued jointly by the Department of Justice, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology on December 19, 2019(e) To ensure Americans have choices among financial institutions and to guard against excessive market power, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Comptroller of the Currency, is encouraged to review current practices and adopt a plan, not later than 180 days after the date of this order, for the revitalization of merger oversight under the Bank Merger Act and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (Public Law 84\u201351170 Stat. 13312 U.S.C. 1841et seq12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(f) To better protect workers from wage collusion, the Attorney General and the Chair of the FTC are encouraged to consider whether to revise the Antitrust Guidance for Human Resource Professionals of October 2016.(g) To address agreements that may unduly limit workers\u2019 ability to change jobs, the Chair of the FTC is encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC\u2019s statutory rulemaking authority under th", "e Federal Trade Commission Act to curtail the unfair use of non-compete clauses and other clauses or agreements that may unfairly limit worker mobility.(h) To address persistent and recurrent practices that inhibit competition, the Chair of the FTC, in the Chair\u2019s discretion, is also encouraged to consider working with the rest of the Commission to exercise the FTC\u2019s statutory rulemaking authority, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, in areas such as:(i) unfair data collection and surveillance practices that may damage competition, consumer autonomy, and consumer privacy;(ii) unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment;(iii) unfair anticompetitive conduct or agreements in the prescription drug industries, such as agreements to delay the market entry of generic drugs or biosimilars;(iv) unfair competition in major Internet marketplaces;(v) unfair occupational licensing restrictions;(vi) unfair tying practices or exclusionary practices in the brokerage or listing of real estate;

The report warns that the risk is particularly acute when it comes to emerging technologies, where China seeks to \u2018surpass and displace the United States altogether [and that] [f]ailure to appreciate the gravity of this challenge and defend U.S. competitiveness would be dire\u2000\u2026 [and] risks setting back U.S. economic and technological progress for decades\u2019.\u201c(5) In remarks before the Hudson Institute on December 8, 2020\u201c(b) PurposeThe purpose of this section [probably means \u201cthis title\u201d, enacting this section and this note] is to require parties providing pre-merger notifications to include in the notification required under section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a \u00a7\u202f19.

Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs(a) Findings and purposes(1) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(A) For over 50 years, most United States medical school seniors and the large majority of graduate medical education programs (popularly known as \u201cresidency programs\u201d) have chosen to use a matching program to match medical students with residency programs to which they have applied. These matching programs have been an integral part of an educational system that has produced the finest physicians and medical researchers in the worl", "d.(B) Before such matching programs were instituted, medical students often felt pressure, at an unreasonably early stage of their medical education, to seek admission to, and accept offers from, residency programs. As a result, medical students often made binding commitments before they were in a position to make an informed decision about a medical specialty or a residency program and before residency programs could make an informed assessment of students\u2019 qualifications. This situation was inefficient, chaotic, and unfair and it often led to placements that did not serve the interests of either medical students or residency programs.(C) The original matching program, now operated by the independent non-profit National Resident Matching Program and popularly known as \u201cthe Match\u201d, was developed and implemented more than 50 years ago in response to widespread student complaints about the prior process. This Program includes on its board of directors individuals nominated by medical student organizations as well as by major medical education and hospital associations.(D) The Match uses a computerized mathematical algorithm, as students had recommended, to analyze the preferences of students and residency programs and match students with their highest preferences from among the available positions in residency programs that listed them. Students thus obtain a residency position in the most highly ranked program on their list that has ranked them sufficiently high among its preferences. Each year, about 85 percent of participating United States medical students secure a place in one of their top 3 residency program choices.(E) Antitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof, have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long-standing process. The costs of defending such litigation would divert the scarce resources of our country\u2019s teaching hospitals and medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and med", "ical research. In addition, such costs may lead to abandonment of the matching process, which has effectively served the interests of medical students, teaching hospitals, and patients for over half a century.(2) PurposesIt is the purpose of this section to\u2014(A) confirm that the antitrust laws do not prohibit sponsoring, conducting, or participating in a graduate medical education residency matching program, or agreeing to do so; and(B) ensure that those who sponsor, conduct or participate in such matching programs are not subjected to the burden and expense of defending against litigation that challenges such matching programs under the antitrust laws.(b) Application of antitrust laws to graduate medical education residency matching programs(1) DefinitionsIn this subsection:(A) Antitrust lawsThe term \u201cantitrust laws\u201d\u2014(i) has the meaning given such term in subsection (a) of section 12 of this titlesection 45 of this title(ii) includes any State law similar to the laws referred to in clause (i).(B) Graduate medical education programThe term \u201cgraduate medical education program\u201d means\u2014(i) a residency program for the medical education and training of individuals following graduation from medical school;(ii) a program, known as a specialty or subspecialty fellowship program, that provides more advanced training; and(iii) an institution or organization that operates, sponsors or participates in such a program.(C) Graduate medical education residency matching programThe term \u201cgraduate medical education residency matching program\u201d means a program (such as those conducted by the National Resident Matching Program) that, in connection with the admission of students to graduate medical education programs, uses an algorithm and matching rules to match students in accordance with the preferences of students and the preferences of graduate medical education programs.(D) StudentThe term \u201cstudent\u201d means any individual who seeks to be admitted to a graduate medical education program.(2) Confirmation of antitrust statusIt shall not", " be unlawful under the antitrust laws to sponsor, conduct, or participate in a graduate medical education residency matching program, or to agree to sponsor, conduct, or participate in such a program. Evidence of any of the conduct described in the preceding sentence shall not be admissible in Federal court to support any claim or action alleging a violation of the antitrust laws.(3) ApplicabilityNothing in this section shall be construed to exempt from the antitrust laws any agreement on the part of 2 or more graduate medical education programs to fix the amount of the stipend or other benefits received by students participating in such programs.(c) Effective dateThis section shall take effect on April 10, 2004April 10, 2004April 10, 2004(Pub.

My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in any accompa", "nying general message.After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.\nHarry S.

Transfer of Functions to the ChairmanIn addition to the functions transferred by the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1950 (64 Stat. 1264Message of the PresidentTo the Congress of the United States:I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganization in the Federal Trade Commission.This Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961 follows upon my message of April 13, 1961The plan provides for greater flexibility in the handling of the business before the Commission, permitting its disposition at different levels so as better to promote its efficient dispatch. Thus matters both of an adjudicatory and regulatory nature may, depending upon their importance and their complexity, be finally consummated by divisions of the Commission, individual Commissioners, hearing examiners, and, subject to the provisions of section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (60 Stat. 241Provision is also made, in order to maintain the fundamental bipartisan concept explicit in the basic statute creating the Commission, for mandatory review of any such decision, report or certification upon the vote of a majority of the Commission less one member.Inasmuch as the assignment of delegated functions in particular cases and with reference to particular problems to divisions of the Commission, to Commissioners, to hearing examiners, to employees and boards of employees must require continuous and flexible handling, depending both upon the amount and nature of the business, that function is placed in the Chairman by section 2 of the plan.By providing sound organizational arrangements, the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the acco", "mpanying reorganization plan will make possible more economical and expeditious administration of the affected functions. It is, however, impracticable to itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the reorganization plan transmitted herewith is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.\nJohn F.

Necessity for regulationFor the reasons hereinafter enumerated, transactions in securities as commonly conducted upon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are effected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulation and control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto, including transactions by officers, directors, and principal security holders, to require appropriate reports, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a national market system for securities and a national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions and the safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regul", "ation and control reasonably complete and effective, in order to protect interstate commerce, the national credit, the Federal taxing power, to protect and make more effective the national banking system and Federal Reserve System, and to insure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in such transactions:(1) Such transactions (a) are carried on in large volume by the public generally and in large part originate outside the States in which the exchanges and over-the-counter markets are located and/or are effected by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; (b) constitute an important part of the current of interstate commerce; (c) involve in large part the securities of issuers engaged in interstate commerce; (d) involve the use of credit, directly affect the financing of trade, industry, and transportation in interstate commerce, and directly affect and influence the volume of interstate commerce; and affect the national credit.(2) The prices established and offered in such transactions are generally disseminated and quoted throughout the United States and foreign countries and constitute a basis for determining and establishing the prices at which securities are bought and sold, the amount of certain taxes owing to the United States and to the several States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and the value of collateral for bank loans.(3) Frequently the prices of securities on such exchanges and markets are susceptible to manipulation and control, and the dissemination of such prices gives rise to excessive speculation, resulting in sudden and unreasonable fluctuations in the prices of securities which (a) cause alternately unreasonable expansion and unreasonable contraction of the volume of credit available for trade, transportation, and industry in interstate commerce, (b) hinder the proper appraisal of the value of securities and thus prevent a fair calculation of taxes owing to the United States and to the several States by owners, buyers, and sellers of securities, and", " (c) prevent the fair valuation of collateral for bank loans and/or obstruct the effective operation of the national banking system and Federal Reserve System.(4) National emergencies, which produce widespread unemployment and the dislocation of trade, transportation, and industry, and which burden interstate commerce and adversely affect the general welfare, are precipitated, intensified, and prolonged by manipulation and sudden and unreasonable fluctuations of security prices and by excessive speculation on such exchanges and markets, and to meet such emergencies the Federal Government is put to such great expense as to burden the national credit.(June 6, 1934, ch. 40448 Stat. 881Pub.

My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 10 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.\nHarry S. Truman. \u00a7\u202f78d\u20131.
