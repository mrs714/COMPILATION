The Board may order the carrier to stop the violation. When a rate, classification, rule, or practice is prescribed under this subsection, the affected carrier may not publish, charge, or collect a different rate and shall adopt the classification and observe the rule or practice prescribed by the Board.(2) The Board shall maintain and revise as necessary standards and procedures for establishing revenue levels for rail carriers providing transportation subject to its jurisdiction under this part that are adequate, under honest, economical, and efficient management, for the infrastructure and investment needed to meet the present and future demand for rail services and to cover total operating expenses, including depreciation and obsolescence, plus a reasonable and economic profit or return (or both) on capital employed in the business. The Board shall make an adequate and continuing effort to assist those carriers in attaining revenue levels prescribed under this paragraph.

A complaint under subsection (a) of this section must be made under section 11701 of this title(c) In a proceeding to challenge the reasonableness of a rate, the Board shall make its determination as to the reasonableness of the challenged rate\u2014(1) within 9 months after the close of the administrative record if the determination is based upon a stand-alone cost presentation; or(2) within 6 months after the close of the administrative record if the determination is based upon the methodology adopted by the Board pursuant to section 10701(d)(3).(d)(1) The Board shall maintain procedures to ensure the expeditious handling of challenges to the reasonableness of railroad rates. The procedures shall include appropriate measures for avoiding delay in the discovery and evidentiary phases of such proceedings and exemption or revocation proceedings, including appropriate sanctions for such delay, and for ensuring prompt disposition of motions and interlocutory administrative appeals.(2)(A) Except as provided under subparagraph (B), in a stand-alone cost rate challenge, the Board shall comply with the following timeline:(i) Discovery shall be completed not later than 150 days after the date on which the challenge is initiated.(ii) The development of the evidentiary record shall be completed not later than 155 days after the date on which discovery is completed under clause (i).(iii) The closing brief shall be submitted not later than 60 days after the date on which the development of the evidentiary record is completed under clause (ii).(iv) A final Board decision shall be issued not later than 180 days after the date on which the evidentiary record is completed under clause (ii).(B) The Board may extend a timeline under sub", "paragraph (A) after a request from any party or in the interest of due process.(Added Pub.

Determination of market dominance in rail rate proceedings(a) In this section, \u201cmarket dominance\u201d means an absence of effective competition from other rail carriers or modes of transportation for the transportation to which a rate applies.(b) When a rate for transportation by a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part is challenged as being unreasonably high, the Board shall determine whether the rail carrier proposing the rate has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies. The Board may make that determination on its ", "own initiative or on complaint. A finding by the Board that the rail carrier does not have market dominance is determinative in a proceeding under this part related to that rate or transportation unless changed or set aside by the Board or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction.(c) When the Board finds in any proceeding that a rail carrier proposing or defending a rate for transportation has market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies, it may then determine that rate to be unreasonable if it exceeds a reasonable maximum for that transportation. However, a finding of market dominance does not establish a presumption that the proposed rate exceeds a reasonable maximum.(d)(1)(A) In making a determination under this section, the Board shall find that the rail carrier establishing the challenged rate does not have market dominance over the transportation to which the rate applies if such rail carrier proves that the rate charged results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for such transportation that is less than 180 percent.(B) For purposes of this section, variable costs for a rail carrier shall be determined only by using such carrier\u2019s unadjusted costs, calculated using the Uniform Rail Costing System cost finding methodology (or an alternative methodology adopted by the Board in lieu thereof) and indexed quarterly to account for current wage and price levels in the region in which the carrier operates, with adjustments specified by the Board. A rail carrier may meet its burden of proof under this subsection by establishing its variable costs in accordance with this paragraph, but a shipper may rebut that showing by evidence of such type, and in accordance with such burden of proof, as the Board shall prescribe.(2) A finding by the Board that a rate charged by a rail carrier results in a revenue-variable cost percentage for the transportation to which the rate applies that is equal to or greater than 180 percent does not establish a presumption that\u2014(A) such rail carrier has or doe", "s not have market dominance over such transportation; or(B) the proposed rate exceeds or does not exceed a reasonable maximum.(Added Pub.

Liability for payment of rates(a)(1) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, is determined under this subsection when the transportation is provided by a rail carrier under this part. When the shipper or consignor instructs the rail carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property\u2014(A) of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and(B) of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.(2) When the consignee is liable only for rates billed at the time of delivery under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner, is liable for those additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the rail carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the rail carrier, and a reconsignor or diverter giving a rail carrier, erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.(b) Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor, named in the bill of lading as consignee, is determined under this subsection when the tr", "ansportation is provided by a rail carrier under this part. When the shipper or consignor gives written notice, before delivery of the property, to the line-haul rail carrier that is to make ultimate delivery\u2014(1) to deliver the property to another party identified by the shipper or consignor as the beneficial owner of the property; and(2) that delivery is to be made to that party on payment of all applicable transportation rates;that party is liable for the rates billed at the time of delivery and for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if that party does not pay the rates required to be paid under paragraph (2) of this subsection on delivery. However, if the party gives written notice to the delivering rail carrier before delivery that the party is not the beneficial owner of the property and gives the rail carrier the name and address of the beneficial owner, then the party is not liable for those additional rates. A shipper, consignor, or party to whom delivery is made that gives the delivering rail carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner, is liable for the additional rates regardless of the bill of lading or contract under which the property was transported. This subsection does not apply to a prepaid shipment of property.(c)(1) A rail carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (a) of this section. That rail carrier must bring the action during the period provided in section 11705(a) of this title(2) A rail carrier may bring an action to enforce liability under subsection (b) of this section.

L. 97\u2013261I am pleased that an agreement between the United States and Mexico has been concluded to ensure fair and reciprocal treatment for charter and tour bus interests on both sides of the border. The agreement reached, however, does not allow for full access to cross-border and domestic markets. Therefore, the moratorium must reflect the conditions under which operating authority may be issued to Mexican charter and tour companies under the agreement.Pursuant to section 6 of the Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, 49 U.S.C. section 10922(l49 U.S.C. 10922(m)(2)(A)The moratorium is modified only to authorize the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant Mexican motor carriers authority to transport passengers in charter or special operations, in foreign commerce, in round trip or one-way service between Mexico and the United States pursuant to the following restrictions:1. The Mexican motor carrier can conduct cross-border charter or special service in the United States only when the international tour or charter begins in Mexico;2. Tickets or tour packages for such operations cannot be sold in the United States; and3. The terms of the grants of authority given to Mexican motor carriers will be limited by the life of the agreement with Mexico covering reciprocal cross-border charter and special operations.This action applies only to international charter and tour operations, does not allow for point-to-point service within the United St", "ates, and does not authorize companies to conduct cross-border regular route service. This action preserves the status quo with respect to Mexican trucking companies and Mexican companies engaged in regular route service, and will maintain the moratorium on those operations through September 25, 1994Accordingly, you are directed to notify the Congress today on my behalf that, effective 60 days hence, the moratorium will no longer be in effect for Mexican charter and tour bus companies subject to the above stated conditions. Because of this action, the Interstate Commerce Commission will then accept and process expeditiously all applications for operating authority from Mexican owned, controlled, or domiciled charter and tour bus firms. I should note that applications in Mexico by United States charter and tour bus firms will be similarly treated.You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.\nWilliam J.
