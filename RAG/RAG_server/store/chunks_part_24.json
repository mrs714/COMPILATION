Depositary services efficiency and cost reduction(a) FindingsThe Congress finds as follows:(1) The Secretary of the Treasury has long compensated financial institutions for various critical depositary and financial agency services provided for or on behalf of the United States by\u2014(A) placing large balances, commonly referred to as \u201ccompensating balances\u201d, on deposit at such institutions; and(B) using imputed interest on such funds to offset charges for the various depositary and financial agency services provided to or on behalf of the Government.(2) As a result of sharp declines in interest rates over the last few years to record low ", "levels, or the public debt outstanding reaching the statutory debt limit, the Department of the Treasury often has had to dramatically increase or decrease the size of the compensating balances on deposit at these financial institutions.(3) The fluctuation of the compensating balances, and the necessary pledging of collateral by financial institutions to secure the value of compensating balances placed with those institutions, have created unintended financial uncertainty for the Secretary of the Treasury and for the management by financial institutions of their cash and securities.(4) It is imperative that the process for providing financial services to the Government be transparent, and provide the information necessary for the Congress to effectively exercise its appropriation and oversight responsibilities.(5) The use of direct payment for services rendered would strengthen cash and debt management responsibilities of the Secretary of the Treasury because the Secretary would no longer need to dramatically increase or decrease the level of such balances when interest rates fluctuate sharply or when the public debt outstanding reaches the statutory debt limit.(6) An alternative to the use of compensating balances, such as direct payments to financial institutions, would ensure that payments to financial institutions for the services they provide would be made in a more predictable manner and could result in cost savings.(7) Limiting the use of compensating balances could result in a more direct and cost-efficient method of obtaining those services currently provided under compensating balance arrangements.(8) A transition from the use of compensating balances to another compensation method must be carefully managed to prevent higher-than-necessary transitional costs and enable participating financial institutions to modify their planned investment of cash and securities.(b) Authorization of appropriations for services rendered by depositaries and financial agencies of the United StatesThere are authorized to be", " appropriated for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 2003 to the Secretary of the Treasury such sums as may be necessary for reimbursing financial institutions in their capacity as depositaries and financial agents of the United States for all services required or directed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or a designee of the Secretary, to be performed by such financial institutions on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury or another Federal agency, including services rendered before fiscal year 2004.(c) Orderly transition(1) In generalAs appropriations authorized in subsection (b) become available, the Secretary of the Treasury shall promptly begin the process of phasing in the use of the appropriations to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and financial agents of the United States, and transitioning from the use of compensating balances to fund these services.(2) Post-transition use limited to extraordinary circumstances(A) In generalFollowing the transition to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury may use the compensating balances to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and financial agents of the United States only in extraordinary situations where the Secretary determines that they are needed to ensure the fiscal operations of the Government continue to function in an efficient and effective manner.(B) ReportAny use of compensating balances pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall promptly be reported by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.(3) Requirements for orderly transitionIn transitioning to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury shall take such steps as may be appropriate to\u2014(A) prevent abrupt financial disruption to the functions of the Department of the Treasury or to the participating financial institutions; and(B) maintain adequat", "e accounting and management controls to ensure that payments to financial institutions for their banking services provided to the Government as depositaries and financial agents are accurate and that the arrangements last no longer than is necessary.(4) Reports required(A) Annual report(i) In generalFor each fiscal year, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report to the Congress on the use of compensating balances and on the use of appropriations authorized in subsection (b) during that fiscal year.(ii) Inclusion in budgetThe report required under clause (i) may be submitted as part of the budget submitted by the President under section 1105 of title 31(B) Final report following transition(i) In generalFollowing completion of the transition from the use of compensating balances to the use of the appropriations authorized in subsection (b) to pay financial institutions for their services as depositaries and financial agents of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report on the transition to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate.(ii) Contents of reportThe report submitted under clause (i) shall include a detailed analysis of\u2014(I) the cost of transition;(II) the direct costs of the services being paid from the appropriations authorized in subsection (b); and(III) the benefits realized from the use of direct payment for such services, rather than the use of compensating balance arrangements.(d) Omitted(e) Effective dateNotwithstanding section 20,11October 28, 2003(Pub.

In the past, some States have refused to recognize the seal of the Census Bureau on the ground that it was not authorized by law.

No. 13986, Jan. 20, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:SectionBackgroundThe census and apportionment processes are enshrined in the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment apportions seats in the House of Representatives \u201camong the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State.\u201d (U.S. Const. amend. XIV, sec. 2.) Article I, in turn, provides that, in order to determine those numbers, an \u201cactual Enumeration\u201d of the population of the United States must be conducted every 10 years. (U.S. Const. art. I, sec. 2, cl. 3.) The Congress has assigned responsibility for conducting the decennial census to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary). (13 U.S.C. 141(a)Once the Secretary, through the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau, takes the count, the President must carry out the apportionment of Representatives among the States. The Secretary prepares the \u201ctabulation of total population by States\u2000\u2026 as required for the apportionment of Representatives,\u201d and reports that tabulation to the President. (13 U.S.C. 141(b)2 U.S.C. 2a(a)2 U.S.C. 2a(b)13 U.S.C. 141(c)At no point since our Nation\u2019s Founding has a person\u2019s immigration status alone served as a basis for excluding that person from the total population count used in apportionment. Before the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, the Constitution did not give equal weight to every person counted under the census. (U.S. Const. art. 1, sec. 2.) In accord with constitutional a", "nd statutory requirements, however, every apportionment since ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment has calculated each State\u2019s share of Representatives based on \u201cthe whole number of persons in each State,\u201d excluding only \u201cIndians not taxed\u201d\u2014an express constitutional exception that no longer has legal or practical effect. (U.S. Const. amend. XIV, sec. 2; 2 U.S.C. 2a(a)See, e.g.,Act of Mar. 1, 1790, ch. 21 Stat. 101Franklin v. MassachusettsEvenwel v. AbbottDuring the 2020 Census, the President announced a policy that broke from this long tradition. It aimed to produce a different apportionment base\u2014one that would, to the maximum extent feasible, exclude persons who are not in a lawful immigration status.

It sets forth in general language the primary responsibilities of the Coast ", "Guard: enforcement of all Federal laws on waters to which they have application, safety of life and property at sea, aiding navigation, and readiness to function with the Navy. Having been created in 1915 by the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service, the Coast Guard has gradually been given additional duties and responsibilities, such as the assignment of law enforcement powers on the high seas and navigable waters in 1936, the transfer of the Lighthouse Service in 1939, and the transfer of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation in 1942. Existing along with these other duties has been that of maintaining a state of readiness as a specialized service prepared for active participation with the Navy in time of war. These various interdependent functions of the Service have not been expressed collectively in any statute heretofore, but it is believed desirable to do so in this revision in order to have outlined in general terms in one section the broad scope of the functions of the Coast Guard. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesPrior ProvisionsA prior section 102 was renumbered section 717 of this titleAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

Removing restrictions\nAny law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency proclaimed by the President any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy, including, but not limited to, restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel, shall, in the same manner and to the same extent, remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard.(Aug. 4, 1949, ch. 39363 Stat. 550Pub. L. 115\u2013282, title I, \u00a7\u202f103(b)Dec. 4, 2018132 Stat. 4195\nHistorical and Revision NotesThis section is new and provides that any law removing for the duration of a war or national emergency any restriction contained in any then-existing law as applied to the Navy shall operate in the same manner to remove such restrictions as applied to the Coast Guard. Included are restrictions relating to the manner in which purchases may be made and contracts awarded, fiscal operations, and personnel. This provision is designed to enable the Coast Guard to operate as efficiently as the Navy Department in time of war or during a national emergency and would permit the Coast Guard more effectively to maintain itself in a state of military readiness during periods of emergency. Since the Coast Guard operates as part of the Navy in time of war, it is essential that it", "s operations be as flexible and as efficient as those of the Department of which it is to be a part. This section would prevent inadvertent failures specifically to mention the Coast Guard in legislation of the type described in this section from hindering service operations. 81st Congress, House Report No. 557.Editorial NotesPrior ProvisionsA prior section 104 was renumbered section 528 of this titleAmendments2018\u2014Pub.

One hundred and twenty of these maritime landmarks are in the State of Michigan.\u201c(2) Lighthouses are an important part of Great Lakes culture and stand as a testament to the importance of shipping in the region\u2019s political, economic, and social history.\u201c(3) Advances in navigation technology have made many Great Lakes lighthouses obsolete. In Michigan alone, approximately 7", "0 lighthouses will be designated as excess property of the Federal Government and will be transferred to the General Services Administration for disposal.\u201c(4) Unfortunately, the Federal property disposal process is confusing, complicated, and not well-suited to disposal of historic lighthouses or to facilitate transfers to nonprofit organizations. This is especially troubling because, in many cases, local nonprofit historical organizations have dedicated tremendous resources to preserving and maintaining Great Lakes lighthouses.\u201c(5) If Great Lakes lighthouses disappear, the public will be unaware of an important chapter in Great Lakes history.\u201c(6) The National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed Michigan lighthouses on their list of Most Endangered Historic Places.\u201c(b) Assistance for Great Lakes Lighthouse Preservation EffortsThe Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, may\u2014\u201c(1) continue to offer advice and technical assistance to organizations in the Great Lakes region that are dedicated to lighthouse stewardship; and\u201c(2) promptly release information regarding the timing of designations of Coast Guard lighthouses on the Great Lakes as excess to the needs of the Coast Guard, to enable those organizations to mobilize and be prepared to take appropriate action with respect to the disposal of those properties.\u201dVHF Communications ServicesPub.

Under existing statutes, functions relating to the Coast Guard have been conferred upon the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commandant, and sometimes upon the Secretary of the Treasury in times of peace and the Secretary of the Navy in times of war. This revision confers some functions directly upon the Coast Guard, and this section provides for the execution of those functions by the Commandant, the military head of the organization, thereby making for consistency and uniformity. The functions are to be executed \u201csubject to the general supervision of the Secretary\u201d.
