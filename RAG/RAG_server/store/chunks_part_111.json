FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) Weapons of mass destruction and related materials and technologies are increasingly available from worldwide sources. Technical information relating to such weapons is readily available on the Internet, and raw materials for chemical, biological, and radiological weapons are widely available for legitimate commercial purposes.(2) The former Soviet Union produced and maintained a vast array of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction.(3) Many of the states of the former Soviet Union retain the facilities, materials, and technologies capable of producing additional quantities of weapons of mass destruction.(4) The disintegration of the former Soviet Union was accompanied by disruptions of command and control systems, deficiencies in accountability for weapons, weapons-related materials and technologies, economic hardships, and significant gaps in border control among the states of the former Soviet Union. The problems of organized crime and corruption in the states of the former Soviet Union increase the potential for proliferation of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons and related materials.(5) The conditions described in paragraph (4) have substantially increased the ability of potentially hostile nations, terrorist groups, and individuals to acquire weapons of mass destruction and related materials and technologies from within the states of the former Soviet Union and from unemployed scientists who worked on those programs.(6) As a result of such conditions, the capability of potentially hostile nations and terrorist groups to acquire nuclear, radiological, biologic", "al, and chemical weapons is greater than at any time in history.(7) The President has identified North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and Libya as hostile states which already possess some weapons of mass destruction and are developing others.(8) The acquisition or the development and use of weapons of mass destruction is well within the capability of many extremist and terrorist movements, acting independently or as proxies for foreign states.(9) Foreign states can transfer weapons to or otherwise aid extremist and terrorist movements indirectly and with plausible deniability.(10) Terrorist groups have already conducted chemical attacks against civilian targets in the United States and Japan, and a radiological attack in Russia.(11) The potential for the national security of the United States to be threatened by nuclear, radiological, chemical, or biological terrorism must be taken seriously.(12) There is a significant and growing threat of attack by weapons of mass destruction on targets that are not military targets in the usual sense of the term.(13) Concomitantly, the threat posed to the citizens of the United States by nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons delivered by unconventional means is significant and growing.(14) Mass terror may result from terrorist incidents involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.(15) Facilities required for production of radiological, biological, and chemical weapons are much smaller and harder to detect than nuclear weapons facilities, and biological and chemical weapons can be deployed by alternative delivery means other than long-range ballistic missiles.(16) Covert or unconventional means of delivery of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons include cargo ships, passenger aircraft, commercial and private vehicles and vessels, and commercial cargo shipments routed through multiple destinations.(17) Traditional arms control efforts assume large state efforts with detectable manufacturing programs and weapons production programs", ", but are ineffective in monitoring and controlling smaller, though potentially more dangerous, unconventional proliferation efforts.(18) Conventional counterproliferation efforts would do little to detect or prevent the rapid development of a capability to suddenly manufacture several hundred chemical or biological weapons with nothing but commercial supplies and equipment.(19) The United States lacks adequate planning and countermeasures to address the threat of nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical terrorism.(20) The Department of Energy has established a Nuclear Emergency Response Team which is available in case of nuclear or radiological emergencies, but no comparable units exist to deal with emergencies involving biological or chemical weapons or related materials.(21) State and local emergency response personnel are not adequately prepared or trained for incidents involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical materials.(22) Exercises of the Federal, State, and local response to nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism have revealed serious deficiencies in preparedness and severe problems of coordination.(23) The development of, and allocation of responsibilities for, effective countermeasures to nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical terrorism in the United States requires well-coordinated participation of many Federal agencies, and careful planning by the Federal Government and State and local governments.(24) Training and exercises can significantly improve the preparedness of State and local emergency response personnel for emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, biological, or chemical weapons or related materials.(25) Sharing of the expertise and capabilities of the Department of Defense, which traditionally has provided assistance to Federal, State, and local officials in neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive ordnance, as well as radiological, biological, and chemical materials, can be a vital contribution to the development and deploy", "ment of countermeasures against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction.(26) The United States lacks effective policy coordination regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.(Pub.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\u201c(a) FindingsCongress finds", " the following:\u201c(1) It is in the vital security interests of the United States to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction to additional states or to terrorist organizations, and to ensure that other nations\u2019 obligations to modify their stockpiles of such arms in accordance with treaties, executive agreements, or political commitments are fulfilled.\u201c(2) In particular, it is in the vital national security interests of the United States to ensure that\u2014\u201c(A) all stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable nuclear material in the Russian Federation are secure and accounted for;\u201c(B) stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable nuclear material that are excess to military needs in the Russian Federation are monitored and reduced;\u201c(C) any chemical or biological weapons, related materials, and facilities in the Russian Federation are destroyed;\u201c(D) the Russian Federation\u2019s nuclear weapons complex is reduced to a size appropriate to its post-Cold War missions, and its experts in weapons of mass destruction technologies are shifted to gainful and sustainable civilian employment;\u201c(E) the Russian Federation\u2019s export control system blocks any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the means of delivering such weapons, and materials, equipment, know-how, or technology that would be used to develop, produce, or deliver such weapons; and\u201c(F) these objectives are accomplished with sufficient monitoring and transparency to provide confidence that they have in fact been accomplished and that the funds provided to accomplish these objectives have been spent efficiently and effectively.\u201c(3) United States programs should be designed to accomplish these vital objectives in the Russian Federation as rapidly as possible, and the President should develop and present to Congress a plan for doing so.\u201c(4) Substantial progress has been made in United States-Russian Federation cooperative programs to achieve these objectives, but much more remains to be done to reduce the urgent risks to United States national security posed by", " the current state of the Russian Federation\u2019s weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and complexes.\u201c(5) The threats posed by inadequate management of weapons of mass destruction stockpiles and complexes in the Russian Federation remain urgent. Incidents in years immediately preceding 2001, which have been cited by the Russia Task Force of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, include\u2014\u201c(A) a conspiracy at one of the Russian Federation\u2019s largest nuclear weapons facilities to steal nearly enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb;\u201c(B) an attempt by an employee of the Russian Federation\u2019s premier nuclear weapons facility to sell nuclear weapons designs to agents of Iraq and Afghanistan; and\u201c(C) the theft of radioactive material from a Russian Federation submarine base.\u201c(6) Addressing these threats to United States and world security will ultimately consume billions of dollars, a burden that will have to be shared by the Russian Federation, the United States, and other governments, if these threats are to be neutralized.\u201c(7) The creation of new funding streams could accelerate progress in reducing these threats to United States security and help the government of the Russian Federation to fulfill its responsibility for secure management of its weapons stockpiles and complexes as United States assistance phases out.\u201c(8) The Russian Federation has a significant foreign debt, a substantial proportion of which it inherited from the Soviet Union.\u201c(9) Past debt-for-environment exchanges, in which a portion of a country\u2019s foreign debt is canceled in return for certain environmental commitments or payments by that country, suggest that a debt-for-nonproliferation exchange with the Russian Federation could be designed to provide additional funding for nonproliferation and arms reduction initiatives.\u201c(10) Most of the Russian Federation\u2019s official bilateral debt is held by United States allies that are advanced industrial democracies. Since the issues described pose threats to United States allies as well, United Stat", "es leadership that results in a larger contribution from United States allies to cooperative threat reduction activities will be needed.\u201c(11) At the June 2002 meeting of the G\u20138 countries, agreement was achieved on a G\u20138 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, under which the advanced industrial democracies committed to contribute $20,000,000,000 to nonproliferation programs in the Russian Federation during a 10-year period, with each contributing country having the option to fund some or all of its contribution through reduction in the Russian Federation\u2019s official debt to that country.\u201c(12) The Russian Federation\u2019s Soviet-era official debt to the United States is estimated to be $480,000,000 in Lend-Lease debt and $2,250,000,000 in debt as a result of credits extended under title I of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [now Food for Peace Act] (7 U.S.C. 1701\u201c(b) PurposesThe purposes of this subtitle are\u2014\u201c(1) to facilitate the accomplishment of the United States objectives described in the findings set forth in subsection (a) by providing for the use of a portion of the Russian Federation\u2019s foreign debt to fund nonproliferation programs, thus allowing the use of additional resources for these purposes; and\u201c(2) to help ensure that the resources made available to the Russian Federation are targeted to the accomplishment of the United States objectives described in the findings set forth in subsection (a).\u201cSEC. 1313.

Replacing our current, aging force is essential, but not sufficient in the more complex nuclear environment we now face to provide the adaptability or flexibility to confidently hold at risk what adversaries value. In particular, if the threat evolves in ways that favorably change the cost/benefit calculus in the view of an adversary\u2019s leadership, then we should be in a position to quickly restore a credible deterrence posture.\u2019.\u201c(3) In a memorandum dated May 9, 2014\u201c(A) \u2018If nuclear military capabilities are to provide deterrence for the nation they need to be relevant to the emerging global strategic environment. The current stockpile was designed to meet the needs of a bipolar world with roots in the Cold War era. A more complex, chaotic, and dynamic security environment is emerging. In order to uphold the Department\u2019s mission to ensure an effective nuclear deterrent.\u2000\u2026 we must ensure our nuclear capabilities meet the challenges of known and potential geopolitical and technological trends. Therefore we must look ahead, using the expertise of our laboratories, to how the capabilities that may be employed by other nations could impact deterrence over the next several decades.\u2019.\u201c(B) \u2018We must challeng", "e our thinking about our programs of record in order to permit foresighted actions that may reduce, in the coming decades, the chances for surprise and that buttress deterrence.\u2019.\u201c(b) Design Competition.\u2014\u201c(1) In generalIn accordance with paragraph (2), the Administrator for Nuclear Security, in coordination with the Chairman of the Nuclear Weapons Council, shall carry out a new and comprehensive design competition for a nuclear warhead that could be employed on ballistic missiles of the United States by 2030. Such competition shall\u2014\u201c(A) examine options for warhead design and related delivery system requirements in the 2030s, including\u2014\u201c(i) life extension of existing weapons;\u201c(ii) new capabilities; and\u201c(iii) such other concepts as the Administrator and the Chairman determine necessary to fully exercise and create responsive design capabilities in the enterprise and ensure a robust nuclear deterrent into the 2030s;\u201c(B) assess how the capabilities and defenses that may be employed by other countries could impact deterrence in 2030 and beyond and how such threats could be addressed or mitigated in the warhead and related delivery systems;\u201c(C) exercise the full set of design skills necessary for an effective nuclear deterrent and responsive enterprise through production of conceptual designs and, as the Administrator determines appropriate, production of non-nuclear prototypes of components or subsystems; and\u201c(D) examine and recommend actions for significantly shortening timelines and significantly reducing costs associated with design, development, certification, and production of the warhead, without reducing worker or public health and safety.\u201c(2) TimingThe Administrator shall\u2014\u201c(A) during fiscal year 2018, develop a plan to carry out paragraph (1); and\u201c(B) during fiscal year 2019, implement such plan.\u201c(c) BriefingNot later than March 1, 2018Plan for Developing Exascale Computing and Incorporating Such Computing Into the Stockpile Stewardship ProgramPub.

No. 13732, July 1, 2016Mar. 6, 2019By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows:SectionPurposeThe protection of civilians is fundamentally consistent with the effective, efficient, and decisive use of force in pursuit of U.S. national interests. Minimizing civilian casualties can further mission objectives; help maintain the support of partner governments and vulnerable populations, especially in the conduct of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations; and enhance the legitimacy and sustainability of U.S. operations critical to our national security. As a matter of policy, the United States therefore routinely imposes certain heightened policy standards that are more protective than the requirements of the law of armed conflict that relate to the protection of civilians.Civilian casualties are a tragic and at times unavoidable consequence of the use of force in situations of armed conflict or in the exercise of a state\u2019s inherent right of self-defense.

When it is determined to be necessary to engage in bulk collection in order to advance a validated intelligence priority, the element of the Intelligence Community shall apply reasonable methods and technical measures in order to limit the data collected to only what is necessary to advance a validated intelligence priority, while minimizing the collection of non-pertinent information.(B) Each element of the Intelligence Community that collects signals intelligence through bulk collection shall use such information only in pursuit of one or more of the following objectives:(1) protecting against terrorism, the taking of hostages, and the holding of individuals captive (including the identification, location, and rescue of hostages and captives) conducted by or on behalf of a foreign government, foreign organization, or foreign person;(2) protecting against espionage, sabotage, assassination, or other intelligence activities conducted by, on behalf of, or with the assistance of a foreign government, foreign organization, or foreign person;(3) protecting against threats from the development, possession, or proliferation of weapons of mass destructio", "n or related technologies and threats conducted by, on behalf of, or with the assistance of a foreign government, foreign organization, or foreign person;(4) protecting against cybersecurity threats created or exploited by, or malicious cyber activities conducted by or on behalf of, a foreign government, foreign organization, or foreign person;(5) protecting against threats to the personnel of the United States or of its allies or partners; and(6) protecting against transnational criminal threats, including illicit finance and sanctions evasion related to one or more of the other objectives identified in subsection (c)(ii) of this section.(C) The President may authorize updates to the list of objectives in light of new national security imperatives, such as new or heightened threats to the national security of the United States, for which the President determines that bulk collection may be used. The Director shall publicly release any updates to the list of objectives authorized by the President, unless the President determines that doing so would pose a risk to the national security of the United States.(D) In order to minimize any impact on privacy and civil liberties, a targeted signals intelligence collection activity that temporarily uses data acquired without discriminants (for example, without specific identifiers or selection terms) shall be subject to the safeguards described in this subsection, unless such data is:(1) used only to support the initial technical phase of the targeted signals intelligence collection activity;(2) retained for only the short period of time required to complete this phase;

In particular, the trafficking by cartels of controlled substances has triggered a resurgence in deadly drug abuse and a corresponding rise in violent crime related to drugs. Likewise, the trafficking and smuggling of human beings by transnational c", "riminal groups risks creating a humanitarian crisis.

No. 14060, Dec. 15, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order as follows:SectionPurposeThese networks continue to expand in size and influence in the United States and abroad. Transnational criminal organizations contrib", "ute directly to tens of thousands of drug-overdose deaths in the United States each year and adversely affect American communities and economic prosperity. They also threaten United States national security by degrading the security and stability of allied and partner nations, undermining the rule of law, fostering corruption, acting as proxies for hostile state activities, directly or indirectly funding insurgent and terrorist groups, depleting natural resources, harming human health and the environment, contributing to climate change through illegal deforestation and logging, and exploiting and endangering vulnerable populations. In some regions, transnational criminal organizations wield state-like capabilities, disregarding sovereign borders, compromising the integrity of democratic institutions and threatening the legitimacy of fragile governments, and securing their power through intimidation, corruption, and violence. For these reasons, it is in the national interest of the United States to counter TOC. Addressing TOC requires a coordinated Federal framework accompanied by a cohesive whole-of-government effort executed in collaboration with State, local, Tribal, territorial, and civil society partners in the United States and in close coordination with foreign partners, international and regional organizations, and international and local civil society groups abroad.Sec.Policy(a) employ authorized intelligence and operational capabilities in an integrated manner to target, disrupt, and degrade transnational criminal organizations that pose the greatest threat to national security;(b) collaborate with private entities and international, multilateral, and bilateral organizations to combat TOC, while also strengthening cooperation with and advancing efforts to build capacity in partner nations to reduce transnational criminal activity;(c) improve information sharing between law enforcement entities and the Intelligence Community to enhance strategic analysis of, and efforts to combat, transnational criminal o", "rganizations and their activities, while also preserving our ability to speedily bring TOC actors to justice;(d) expand tools and capabilities to combat illicit finance, which underpins all TOC activities; and(e) develop and deploy new technologies to identify and disrupt existing and newly emerging TOC threats.Sec.Establishments(i) The USCTOC shall replace the Threat Mitigation Working Group, previously directed to lead whole-of-government efforts on TOC under Executive Order 13773 of February 9, 2017(ii) The USCTOC shall consist of the following members or their designees:(A) the Secretary of State;(B) the Secretary of the Treasury;(C) the Secretary of Defense;(D) the Attorney General;(E) the Secretary of Homeland Security; and(F) the Director of National Intelligence.(iii) The USCTOC may request other agencies to contribute to the USCTOC\u2019s efforts as necessary, including by detail or assignment of personnel consistent with subsection (b)(v) of this section.(iv) The USCTOC shall meet not later than 60 days from the date of this order [Dec. 15, 2021(b) There shall be established a USCTOC Strategic Division (Division), an interagency working group housed at the Department of Justice, comprising personnel from agencies designated in subsection (a)(ii) of this section.(i) The Division shall produce coordinated strategic plans for whole-of-government counter-TOC efforts in support of and in alignment with policy priorities established by the President through the National Security Council.

Biden, Jr.\nSteps for Increased Legal and Policy Transparency Concerning the United States Use of Military Force and Related National Security OperationsMemorandum of President of the United States, Dec. 5, 2016Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesSince my earliest days in office, I have emphasized the importance of transparency and my commitment to making as much information as possible available to the Congress and the public about the United States use of military force and related national security operations. Doing so, I believe, not only supports the process of democratic decision making, but also demonstrates the legitimacy and strengthens the sustainability of our operations while promoting mutual understanding with our allies and partners.The United States has used military force and conducted related national security operations within legal and policy frameworks that are designed to ensure that such operations are lawful and effective and that they serve our interests and values. Consistent with my commitment to transparency, my Administration has provided to the public an unprecedented amount of information regarding these frameworks through speeches, public statement", "s, reports, and other materials. We have attempted to explain, consistent with our national security and the proper functioning of the executive branch, when and why the United States conducts such operations, the legal basis and policy parameters for such operations, and how such operations have unfolded, so that the American people can better understand them.In addition to the efforts we have made to date, there is still more work that can be done to inform the public. Thus, consistent with my Administration\u2019s previous efforts, by this memorandum I am directing national security departments and agencies to take additional steps to share with the public further information relating to the legal and policy frameworks within which the United States uses military force and conducts related national security operations. Accordingly, I hereby direct as follows:SectionReportSecKeeping the Public InformedSecDefinitions\u201cNational security departments and agencies\u201d include the Departments of State, the Treasury, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, and such other agencies as the President may designate.\u201cRelated national security operations\u201d include operations deemed relevant and appropriate by national security departments and agencies for inclusion in the report described in section 1 of this memorandum, such as detention, transfer, and interrogation operations.SecPublication\nBarack Obama.\nNational Security Presidential Memorandum\u20132.

Cole in Yemen, and against innocent civilians in countries around the world, including the 2004 attack on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain and the 2005 bombings of the mass transit system in London, England.\u201c(5) Following the September 11, 2001\u201c(6) President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional forces and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan as \u2018the central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism\u2019.\u201c(7) The valiant members of the United States Armed Forces have courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and its affiliates in Afghanistan and around the world.\u201c(8) The anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence community have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the world with tremendous dedication, sacrifice, and professionalism.\u201c(9) The close collaboration between the Armed Forces and the intelligence community prompted the Director of National Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, \u2018Never have I seen a more remarkable example of focused integration, seamless collaboration, and sheer professional magnificence as was demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the u", "ltimate demise of Osama bin Laden.\u2019.\u201c(10) While the death of Osama bin Laden represents a significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its affiliates and to terrorist organizations around the world, terrorism remains a critical threat to United States national security.\u201c(11) President Obama said, \u2018For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda\u2019s leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our Nation\u2019s effort to defeat al Qaeda.\u2019.\u201c(b) Sense of CongressIt is the sense of Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) the raid that killed Osama bin Laden demonstrated the best of the intelligence community\u2019s capabilities and teamwork;\u201c(2) for years to come, Americans will look back at this event as a defining point in the history of the United States;\u201c(3) it is vitally important that the United States memorialize all the events that led to the raid so that future generations will have an official record of the events that transpired before, during, and as a result of the operation; and\u201c(4) preserving this history now will allow the United States to have an accurate account of the events while those that participated in the events are still serving in the Government.\u201c(c) Report on the Operation That Killed Osama Bin LadenNot later than 90 days after the completion of the report being prepared by the Center for the Study of Intelligence that documents the history of and lessons learned from the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit such report to the congressional intelligence committees.\u201c(d) Preservation of RecordsThe Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall preserve any records, including intelligence information and assessments, used to generate the report described in subsection (c).\u201d[For definitions of \u201cintelligence community\u201d and \u201ccongressional intelligence committees\u201d as used in section 414 of Pub.
