Many of those answering the call to serve make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and many others carry physical and emotional scars for the rest of their lives.The Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1001For the last decade, veterans seeking loan discharges have been required to submit an application to the Secretary of Education with proof of their disabilities obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The process has been overly complicated and difficult, and prevented too many of our veterans from receiving the relief for which they are eligible. This has inflicted significant hardship and serious harm on these veterans and has frustrated the intent of the Congress that their Federal student loan debt be discharged.Only half of the approximately 50,000 totally and permanently disabled veterans who currently qualify for the discharge of their Federal student loan debt have availed themselves of the benefits provided to them by the Higher Education Act. This has created a serious and critical problem for disabled veterans, who must deal with the day-to-d", "ay consequences of their service-connected injuries, and for our military, as readiness and recruitment suffer when we do not take care of our veterans. There is a pressing need to quickly and effectively resolve this problem. Therefore, my Administration will take prompt action to ensure that all totally and permanently disabled veterans are able to obtain, with minimal burden, the Federal student loan debt discharges to which they are legally entitled.Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to express the gratitude of our Nation for the service of our totally and permanently disabled veterans, I hereby direct the following:SectionPolicySecDirective to the Secretaries of Education and Veterans Affairs20 U.S.C. 108720 U.S.C. 1087e20 U.S.C. 1087dd(b) The Secretaries of Education and Veterans Affairs (Secretaries) shall take appropriate action to implement the policy set forth in section 1 of this memorandum as expeditiously as possible. To that end, the Secretaries shall consider all pathways for the Department of Veterans Affairs to share disability determinations with the Department of Education, so that veterans may be relieved of the burdensome administrative impediments to Federal student loan debt discharge.SecDefinitions(a) the term \u201cFederal student loan debt\u201d means liability to repay Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans, William D.

Nearly two-thirds of college graduates borrow to pay for college, with an average debt upon graduation of about $26,300. While a college education remains an excellent investment, this debt can be overly burdensome, especially for recent graduates during the first few years of their careers.The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan for Federal student loans currently allows former students to cap their student loan payments at 15 percent of their current discretionary income. This plan can be an effective tool for helping individuals to manage their debt, especially during challenging economic times.Over the past several years, my Administration has worked to improve repayment options available to borrowers, including through passage of an enhanced Income-Based Repayment plan, which will cap a Federal student loan borrower\u2019s monthly payments at 10 percent of his or her discretionary income starting in 2014. And we are pursuing administrative action that may extend these lower payments to some students as soon as the end of this calendar year.However, too few borrowers are aware of the options available to them to help manage their student loan debt, including reducing their monthly payment through IBR. Additionally, too many borrowers have had difficulties navigating and completing the IBR application process once they have started it.For many borrowers, the most significant challenge in completing the IBR application has been the income-verification process, whic", "h, until recently, required borrowers to provide a signed copy of their income tax return. Although the Department of Education has recently removed some of the hurdles to completing the process, too many borrowers are still struggling to access this important repayment option due to difficulty in applying.Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:SectionStreamlined Application Process for Income-Based Repayment PlansSeptember 30, 2012SecIntegrated Online and Mobile Resources for Loan Repayment Options and Debt ManagementJuly 15, 2012(a) create integrated online and mobile resources for students and former students to use in learning about Federal student aid, including an explanation of (1) the current IBR plan, which allows student loan borrowers to cap their monthly loan payments at 15 percent of their discretionary income and be eligible to have their remaining loan balances forgiven after 25 years of responsible payments; and (2) the proposed Pay As You Earn plan, which will allow many students to cap their monthly loan repayments at 10 percent of their discretionary income and be eligible for loan forgiveness after 20 years of responsible repayment; and(b) develop and make available to borrowers an online tool to help students make better financial decisions, including understanding their loan debt and its impact on their everyday lives. This tool should incorporate key elements of best practices in financial literacy and link to students\u2019 actual Federal loan data to help them understand their individual circumstances and options for repayment.SecImproved Notification of the Income-Based Repayment PlanSecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and ", "subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.The Secretary of Education is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama.\nEstablishing a White House Task Force To Protect Students From Sexual AssaultMemorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesMemorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 22, 2014The prevalence of rape and sexual assault at our Nation\u2019s institutions of higher education is both deeply troubling and a call to action. Studies show that about one in five women is a survivor of attempted or completed sexual violence while in college. In addition, a substantial number of men experience sexual violence during college. Although schools have made progress in addressing rape and sexual assault, more needs to be done to ensure safe, secure environments for students of higher education.There are a number of Federal laws aimed at making our campuses safer, and the Departments of Education and Justice have been working to enforce them. Among other requirements, institutions of higher education participating in Federal student financial assistance programs (institutions), including colleges, universities, community colleges, graduate and professional schools, for-profit schools, trade schools, and career and technical schools, must provide students with information on programs aimed at preventing rape and sexual assault, and on procedures for students to reporting rape and sexual assault. Institutions must also adopt and publish grievance procedures that provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of rape and sexual assault complaints, and investigate reports of rape and sexual assault and take swift action to prevent their recurrence. Survivors of rape and sexua", "l assault must also be provided with information on how to access the support and services they need. Reports show, however, that institutions\u2019 compliance with these Federal laws is uneven and, in too many cases, inadequate. Building on existing enforcement efforts, we must strengthen and address compliance issues and provide institutions with additional tools to respond to and address rape and sexual assault.Therefore, I am directing the Office of the Vice President and the White House Council on Women and Girls to lead an interagency effort to address campus rape and sexual assault, including coordinating Federal enforcement efforts by executive departments and agencies (agencies) and helping institutions meet their obligations under Federal law. To these ends, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionEstablishment of the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault(a) Membership of the Task Force. In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:(i) the Attorney General;(ii) the Secretary of the Interior;(iii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;(iv) the Secretary of Education;(v) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;(vi) the Director of the Domestic Policy Council;(vii) the Cabinet Secretary; and(viii) the heads of agencies or offices as the Co-Chairs may designate.(b) A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, senior officials who are part of the member\u2019s agency or office, and who are full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government.SecMission and Function of the Task Force(i) providing institutions with evidence-based best and promising practices for preventing and responding to rape and sexual assault;(ii) building on the Federal Government\u2019s existing enforcement efforts to ensure that institutions comply fully with their legal obligations to prevent and respond to rape and sexual assault;(iii) increasing the transparency of the Federal Government\u2019s enforcement activit", "ies concerning rape and sexual assault, consistent with applicable law and the interests of affected students;(iv) broadening the public\u2019s awareness of individual institutions\u2019 compliance with their legal obligation to address rape and sexual assault; and(v) facilitating coordination among agencies engaged in addressing rape and sexual assault and those charged with helping bring institutions into compliance with the law.(b) In accordance with applicable law and in addition to regular meetings, the Task Force shall consult with external stakeholders, including institution officials, student groups, parents, athletic and educational associations, local rape crisis centers, and law enforcement agencies.(c) Because rape and sexual assault also occur in the elementary and secondary school context, the Task Force shall evaluate how its proposals and recommendations may apply to, and may be implemented by, schools, school districts, and other elementary and secondary educational entities receiving Federal financial assistance.SecAction Plan(i) providing examples of instructions, policies, and protocols for institutions, including: rape and sexual assault policies; prevention programs; crisis intervention and advocacy services; complaint and grievance procedures; investigation protocols; adjudicatory procedures; disciplinary sanctions; and training and orientation modules for students, staff, and faculty;(ii) measuring the success of prevention and response efforts at institutions, whether through compliance with individual policies or through broader assessments of campus climate, attitudes and safety, and providing the public with this information;(iii) maximizing the Federal Government\u2019s effectiveness in combatting campus rape and sexual assault by, among other measures, making its enforcement activities transparent and accessible to students and prospective students nationwide; and(iv) promoting greater coordination and consistency among the agencies and offices that enforce the Federal laws addressing campus rape a", "nd sexual assault and support improved campus responses to sexual violence.(b) Within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, and then on an annual basis, the Task Force shall provide a report to the President on implementation efforts with respect to this memorandum.SecGeneral Provisions(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an agency or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(c) The heads of agencies and offices shall assist and provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Task Force.

College remains a good investment, resulting in higher earnings and a lower risk of unemployment. Unfortunately, for many low- and middle-income families, college is slipping out of reach. Over the past three decades, the average tuition at a public four-year college has more than tripled, while a typical family\u2019s income has increased only modestly. More students than ever are relying on loans to pay for college. Today, 71 percent of those earning a bachelor\u2019s degree graduate with debt, which averages $29,400. While most students are able to repay their loans, many feel burdened by debt, especially as they seek to start a family, buy a ", "home, launch a business, or save for retirement.Over the past several years, my Administration has worked to ensure that college remains affordable and student debt is manageable, including through raising the maximum Pell Grant award by nearly $1,000, creating the American Opportunity Tax Credit, and expanding access to student loan repayment plans, where monthly obligations are calibrated to a borrower\u2019s income and debt. These income-driven repayment plans, like my Pay As You Earn plan, which caps a Federal student loan borrower\u2019s payments at 10 percent of income, can be an effective tool to help individuals manage their debt, and pursue their careers while avoiding consequences of defaulting on a Federal student loan, such as a damaged credit rating, a tax refund offset, or garnished wages.While my Administration has made significant strides in expanding repayment options available to borrowers and building awareness of income-driven repayment plans, more needs to be done. Currently, not all student borrowers of Federal Direct Loans can cap their monthly loan payments at 10 percent of income, and too many struggling borrowers are still unaware of the options available to them to help responsibly manage their debt.Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:SectionExpanding the President\u2019s Pay As You Earn Plan to More Federal Direct Loan BorrowersDecember 31, 2015SecImproving Communication Strategies to Help Vulnerable BorrowersDecember 31, 2014SecEncouraging Support and Awareness of Repayment Options for Borrowers During Tax Filing SeasonSeptember 30, 2014SecPromoting Stronger Collaboration to Ensure That Students and Their Families Have the Information They Need to Make Informed Borrowing DecisionsSeptember 30, 2014SecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, admin", "istrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(d) The Secretary of Education is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama.\nStudent Aid Bill of Rights To Help Ensure Affordable Loan RepaymentMemorandum of President of the United States, Mar. 10, 2015Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury[,] the Secretary of Education[,] the Commissioner of Social Security[,] the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[,] the Director of the Office of Management and Budget[,] the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[, and] the Director of the Domestic Policy CouncilAmerica thrived in the 20th century in large part because we had the most educated workforce in the world. Today, more than ever, Americans need knowledge and skills to meet the demands of a growing global economy. Since many students borrow to pay for postsecondary education, it is imperative they be able to manage their debt as they embark on their careers.My Administration has taken historic action to ensure that college remains affordable and student debt remains manageable. We have eliminated tens of billions of dollars in student loan subsidies paid to banks in order to increase the maximum Pell grant by nearly $1,000 and provide a path for borrowers to limit payments on many student loans to 10 percent of income, and we have worked with the Congress to enact the American Opportunity Tax Credit, worth $10,000 over 4 years of college. We have promoted innovation and competition to bring down college costs, increased completion rates, and given consumers clear, transparent information on colleg", "e performance.College remains an excellent investment, and student loans enable many who could not otherwise do so to access further education. However, there is more work to do to help students repay their loans responsibly. In 2013, college graduates owed an average of $28,400 in Federal and private loans. More than one in eight Federal borrowers default on their loans within 3 years of leaving school. My Administration has already put in place significant protections that ensure borrowers with credit cards and mortgages are treated fairly. We can and should do much more to give students affordable ways to meet their responsibilities and repay their loans.Now is the time for stronger protections for the more than 40 million Americans with student loan debt. All student loan borrowers should have access to an efficient and responsive complaint and feedback system that holds loan servicers accountable and promotes transparency, the information and flexibility they need to repay their loan responsibly and avoid default, and protections to ensure that they will be treated fairly even if they struggle to repay their loans.Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:SectionState-of-the-Art Complaint and Feedback System.(a) Complaints and Feedback Regarding Federal Financial AidJuly 1, 2016October 1, 2017October 1, 2015(b) Coordination Among Other Enforcement AgenciesOctober 1, 2015SecHelping Borrowers Repay Their Loans and Avoid Default.(a) Higher Standards for Federal Direct Loan ServicingJanuary 1, 2016(b) Regular Review of Student Loan Performance and Borrower TrendsAugust 1, 2015(c) Additional Protections for Student Loan BorrowersOctober 1, 2015(d) Higher Customer Service Standards in Income-Driven Repayment PlansOctober 1, 2015(e) Finding New and Better Ways to Communicate with Student Loan BorrowersJanuary 1, 2016January 1, 2017(f) Making it Easier for Federal Direct Student Loan Borrowers to Repay Their S", "tudent LoansSecFair Treatment for Struggling and Distressed Borrowers.(a) Raising Standards for Student Loan Debt CollectorsJuly 1, 2015January 1, 2016(b) Providing Clarity on the Rights of Borrowers in BankruptcyJuly 1, 2015(c) Protecting Social Security Benefits for Borrowers with DisabilitiesJuly 1, 2015(d) Debt Collection Pilot ProgramJuly 1, 2016SecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(d) The Secretary of Education is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f1092a.

Findings; purpose; and program authority(a) FindingsCongress makes the following findings:(1) Hispanic Americans are at high risk of not enrolling or graduating from institutions of higher education.(2) Disparities between the enrollment of non-Hispanic white students and Hispanic students in postsecondary education are increasing. Between 1973 and 1994, enrollment of white secondary school graduates in 4-year institutions of higher education increased at a rate two times higher than that of Hispanic secondary school graduates.(3) Despite significant limitations in resources, Hispanic-serving institutions provide a significant proportion of postsecondary opportunities for Hispanic students.(4) Relative to other institutions of higher education, Hispanic-serving institutions are underfunded. Such institutions receive significantly less in State and local funding, per full-time equivalent student, than other institutions of higher education.(5) Hispanic-serving institutions are succeeding in educating Hispanic students despite significant resource problems that\u2014(A) limit the ability of such institutions to expand and improve the academic programs of such institutions; and(B) could imperil the financial and administrative stability of such institutions.", "(6) There is a national interest in remedying the disparities described in paragraphs (2) and (4) and ensuring that Hispanic students have an equal opportunity to pursue postsecondary opportunities.(b) PurposeThe purpose of this subchapter is to\u2014(1) expand educational opportunities for, and improve the academic attainment of, Hispanic students; and(2) expand and enhance the academic offerings, program quality, and institutional stability of colleges and universities that are educating the majority of Hispanic college students and helping large numbers of Hispanic students and other low-income individuals complete postsecondary degrees.(c) Program authorityThe Secretary shall provide grants and related assistance to Hispanic-serving institutions to enable such institutions to improve and expand their capacity to serve Hispanic students and other low-income individuals.(Pub.
