Findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds and declares that\u2014(1) although significant progress has been made in the production of geologic maps since the establishment of the national cooperative geologic mapping program in 1992, no modern, digital, geologic map exists for approximately 75 percent of the United States;(2) geologic maps are the primary data base for virtually all applied and basic earth-science investigations, including\u2014(A) exploration for and development of mineral, energy, and water resources;(B) screening and characterizing sites for toxic and nuclear waste disposal;(C) land use evaluation and planning for homeland and environmental protection;(D) earthquake hazards reduction;(E) identifying volcanic hazards;(F) design and construction of infrastructure requirements such as utility lifelines, transportation corridors, and surface-water impoundments;(G) reducing losses from landslides and other ground failures;(H) mitigating effects of coastal and stream erosion;(I) siting of critical facilities;(J) recreation and public awareness; and(K) basic earth-science research;(3) Federal agencies, State and local governments, private industry, and the general public depend on the information provided by geologic maps to determine the extent of potential environmental damage before embarking on projects that could lead to preventable, costly environmental problems or litigation;(4) the combined capabilities of State, Federal, and academic groups to provide geologic mapping are not sufficient to meet the present and future needs of the United States for national security, environmental protection, and energy self-sufficiency of the Nation;(5) States are willing to contribute 50 percent of the funding necessary to", " complete the mapping of the geology within the State;(6) the lack of proper geologic maps has led to the poor design of such structures as dams and waste-disposal facilities;(7) geologic maps have proven indispensable in the search for needed fossil-fuel and mineral resources;(8) geologic map information is required for the sustainable and balanced development of natural resources of all types, including energy, minerals, land, water, and biological resources;(9) advances in digital technology and geographical information system science have made geologic map databases increasingly available as decision support tools for land and resource management; and(10) a comprehensive nationwide program of geologic mapping of surficial and bedrock deposits is required in order to systematically build the Nation\u2019s geologic-map data base at a pace that responds to increasing demand.(b) PurposeThe purpose of sections 31a to 31h of this title is to expedite the production of a geologic-map data base for the Nation, to be located within the United States Geological Survey, which can be applied to land-use management, assessment, and utilization, conservation of natural resources, groundwater management, and environmental protection and management.(Pub.

My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of an Assistant Secretary of the Interior and an Administrative Assistant Sec", "retary of the Interior. The rate of compensation fixed for these officers is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.\nHarry S. Truman.The White HouseMarch 13, 1950 \u201cSECTION 1.

Relinquishment of selections partly within conservation units\nWhenever a valid State or Native selection is partly in and partly out of the boundary of a conservation system unit, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the State or any Native Corporation may relinquish its rights in any portion of any validly selected Federal land, including land underneath waters, whi", "ch lies within the boundary of the conservation system unit. Upon relinquishment, the Federal land (including land underneath waters) so relinquished within the boundary of the conservation system unit shall become, and be administered as, a part of the conservation system unit. The total land entitlement of the State or Native Corporation shall not be affected by such relinquishment. In lieu of the lands and waters relinquished by the State, the State may select pursuant to the Alaska Statehood Act as amended by this Act, an equal acreage of other lands available for such purpose. The Native Corporation may retain an equal acreage from overselection lands on which selection applications were otherwise properly and timely filed. A relinquishment pursuant to this section shall not invalidate an otherwise valid State or Native Corporation land selection outside the boundaries of the conservation system unit, on the grounds that, after such relinquishment, the remaining portion of the land selection no longer meets applicable requirements of size, compactness, or contiguity, or that the portion of the selection retained immediately outside the conservation system unit does not follow section lines along the boundary of the conservation system unit. The validity of the selection outside such boundary shall not be adversely affected by the relinquishment.(Pub.

Congressional findings and declarationThe Congress finds and declares that:(a) The early development and delivery of oil and gas from Alaska\u2019s North Slope to domestic markets is in the national interest because of growing domestic shortages and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign sources.(b) The Department of the Interior and other Federal agencies, have, over a long period of time, conducted extensive studies of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed trans-Alaska oil pipeline, including consideration of a trans-Canada pipeline.(c) The earliest possible construction of a trans-Alaska oil pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska to Port Valdez in that State will make the extensive proven and potential reserves of low-sulfur oil available for domestic use and will best serve the national interest.(d) A supplemental pipeline to connect the North Slope with a trans-Canada pipeline may be needed later and it should be studied now, but it should not be regarded as an alternative for a trans-Alaska pipeline that does not traverse a foreign country.(Pub.
