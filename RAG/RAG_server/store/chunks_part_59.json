For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of an individual who is an employee without regard to section 401(c)(1), determination of whether or not any distribution is a lump sum distribution shall be made without regard to the requirement that an election be made under subsection (e)(4)(B) of section 402, but no distribution to any taxpayer other than an individual, estate, or trust may be treated as a lump sum distribution under this paragraph.\u201c(B) Cross reference\u201cFor imposition of separate tax on ordinary income portion of lump sum distribution, see section 402(e).\u201dSubsec.

extent of the aggregate income on the contract from all individual retirement plans of the distributee), and(III) appropriate adjustments shall be made in applying section 72 to other distributions in such taxable year and subsequent taxable years.(I) Waiver of 60-day requirementThe Secretary may waive the 60-day requirement under subparagraphs (A) and (D) where the failure to waive such

The Secretary shall determine such average on an annual basis and may prescribe equivalent rates for years in any such 25-year period for which the rates described in any such clause are not available.

optional forms of benefits provided under the plan (including lump sum distributions, determined on the basis of the plan\u2019s experience and other related assumptions), and(B) any difference in the present value of such future benefit payments resulting from the use of actuarial assumptions, in determining benefit payments in any such optional form of benefits, which are different from those

may be changed without the approval of the Secretary.(B) Plans to which paragraph appliesThis paragraph shall apply to a plan only if\u2014(i) the plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a

benefits) exceed $50,000,000, and(iii) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the funding shortfall of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the funding target of the plan before such change.(i) Special rules for

shall be determined by the plan sponsor based on the standard or average contribution base units which the plan sponsor determines to be representative for active participants and such other factors as the plan sponsor determines to be relevant. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the ability of the plan sponsor to prepare and provide the bargaining parties with alternative schedules to the default schedule that establish lower or higher accrual and contribution rates than the rates otherwise described in this paragraph.(7) Automatic employer surcharge(A) Imposition of surchargeEach employer otherwise obligated to make a contribution for the initial critical year shall be obligated to pay to the plan for such year a surcharge equal to 5 percent of the contribution otherwise required under the applicable collective bargaining agreement (or other agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes).
