Standardization of equipment with North Atlantic Treaty Organization members(a) It is the policy of the United States to standardize equipment, including weapons systems, ammunition, and fuel, procured for the use of the armed forces of the United States stationed in Europe under the North Atlantic Treaty or at least to make that equipment interoperable with equipment of other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To carry out this policy, the Secretary of Defense shall\u2014(1) assess the costs and possible loss of nonnuclear combat effectiveness of the military forces of the members of the Organization caused by the failure of the members to standardize equipment;(2) maintain a list of actions to be taken, including an evaluation of the priority and effect of the action, to standardize equipment that may improve the overall nonnuclear defense capability of the Organization or save resources for the Organization; and(3) initiate and carry out, to the maximum extent feasible, procurement procedures to acqui", "re standardized or interoperable equipment, considering the cost, function, quality, and availability of the equipment.(b) Progress in realizing the objectives of standardization and interoperability would be enhanced by expanded inter-Allied procurement of arms and equipment within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Expanded inter-Allied procurement would be made easier by greater reliance on licensing and coproduction cooperative agreements among the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. If constructed to preserve the efficiencies associated with economies of scale, the agreements could minimize potential economic hardship to parties to the agreements and increase the survivability, in time of war, of the North Atlantic Alliance\u2019s armaments production base by dispersing manufacturing facilities. In conjunction with other members of the Organization and to the maximum extent feasible, the Secretary shall\u2014(1) identify areas in which those cooperative agreements may be made with members of the Alliance; and(2) negotiate those agreements.(c)(1) It is the sense of Congress that weapons systems being developed wholly or primarily for employment in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization theater should conform to a common Organization requirement in order to proceed toward joint doctrine and planning and to facilitate maximum feasible standardization and interoperability of equipment, and that a common Organization requirement should be understood to include a common definition of the military threat to the members of the Organization.(2) It is further the sense of Congress that standardization of weapons and equipment within the Organization on the basis of a \u201ctwo-way street\u201d concept of cooperation in defense procurement between Europe and North America can only work in a realistic sense if the European nations operate on a united and collective basis. Therefore, the governments of Europe are encouraged to accelerate their present efforts to achieve European armaments collaboration among all European members ", "of the Organization.[(d) Repealed.

Energy policy of the Department of Defense(a) General Energy PolicyThe Secretary of Defense shall ensure the readiness of the armed forces for their military missions by pursuing energy security and energy resilience.(b) AuthoritiesIn order to achieve the policy set forth in subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense may\u2014(1) establish metrics and standards for the assessment of energy resilience;(2) require the Secretary of a military department to perform mission assurance and readiness assessments of energy power systems for mission critical assets and supporting infrastructure, applying uniform mission standards established by the Secretary of Defense;(3) require the Secretary of a military department to establish and maintain an energy resilience master plan for an installation;(4) authorize the use of energy security and energy resilience, including the benefits of on-site generation resources that reduce or avoid the cost of backup power, as factors in the cost-benefit analysis for procurement of energy; and(5) in selecting facility energy projects that will use renewable energy sources, pursue energy security and energy resilience by giving favorable consideration to projects that provide power directly to a military facility or into the installation electrical distribution network.(c) Energy Performance Goals(1) The Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees the energy performance goals for the Department of Defense regarding transportation systems, support systems, utilities, and infrastructure and facilities.(2) The energy performance goals shall be submitted annually not later than the date on which the President submits to Congress the budget for the next fiscal year ", "under section 1105 of title 31(3) The Secretary of Defense shall include the energy security and resilience goals of the Department of Defense in the report submitted under section 2925(a) of this title(d) Energy Performance Master Plan(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop a comprehensive master plan for the achievement of the energy performance goals of the Department of Defense, as set forth in laws, executive orders, and Department of Defense policies.(2) The master plan shall include the following:(A) A separate master plan, developed by each military department and Defense Agency, for the achievement of energy performance goals.(B) The use of a baseline standard for the measurement of energy consumption by transportation systems, support systems, utilities, and facilities and infrastructure that is consistent for all of the military departments.(C) A method of measurement of reductions or conservation in energy consumption that provides for the taking into account of changes in the current size of fleets, number of facilities, and overall square footage of facility plants.(D) Metrics to track annual progress in meeting energy performance goals.(E) A description of specific requirements, and proposed investments, in connection with the achievement of energy performance goals reflected in the budget of the President for each fiscal year (as submitted to Congress under section 1105(a) of title 31(F) The up-to date list of energy-efficient products maintained under section 2915(e)(2) of this title(3) Not later than 30 days after the date on which the budget of the President is submitted to Congress for a fiscal year under section 1105(a) of title 31(e) Special ConsiderationsFor the purpose of developing and implementing the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan, the Secretary of Defense shall consider at a minimum the following:(1) Opportunities to reduce the current rate of consumption of energy, the future demand for energy, and the requirement for the use of energy.(2) Opportunities", " to enhance energy resilience to ensure the Department of Defense has the ability to prepare for and recover from energy disruptions that affect mission assurance on military installations.(3) Opportunities to implement conservation measures to improve the efficient use of energy.(4) Opportunities to pursue alternative energy initiatives, including the use of alternative fuels and hybrid-electric drive in military vehicles and equipment.(5) Opportunities for the high-performance construction, lease, operation, and maintenance of buildings.(6) Cost effectiveness, cost savings, and net present value of alternatives.(7) The value of diversification of types and sources of energy used.(8) The value of economies-of-scale associated with fewer energy types used.(9) The value of the use of renewable energy sources.(10) The value of incorporating electric, hybrid-electric, and high efficiency vehicles into vehicle fleets.(11) The potential for an action to serve as an incentive for members of the armed forces and civilian personnel to reduce energy consumption or adopt an improved energy performance measure.(12) Opportunities for improving energy security for facility energy projects that will use renewable energy sources.(13) Opportunities to leverage financing provided by a non-Department entity to address installation energy needs.(14) The reliability and security of energy resources in the event of a military conflict.(15) The value of resourcing energy from partners and allies of the United States.(f) Selection of Energy Conservation MeasuresFor the purpose of implementing the energy performance master plan, the Secretary of Defense shall provide that the selection of energy conservation measures, including energy efficient maintenance, shall be limited to those measures that\u2014(1) are readily available;(2) demonstrate an economic return on the investment;(3) are consistent with the energy performance goals and energy performance master plan for the Department;
