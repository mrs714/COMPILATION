The Office shall make this determination at least every 3 years and when a participating company withdraws.(c) The Office shall establish a formula under which the amount of insurance retained by an issuing company after ceding reinsurance, and the amount of reinsurance ceded to each reinsurer, is in proportion to the total amount of each company\u2019s group life insurance, excluding insurance purchased under this chapter, in force in the United States on the determination date, which is the most recent December 31 for which information is available to the Office.

Basic tables of premium rates(a) A policy purchased under this chapter shall include, for the first policy year, basic tables of premium rates as follows:(1) For group life insurance, a schedule of basic premium rates by age which the Office of Personnel Management determines to be consistent with the lowest schedule of basic premium rates generally charged for new group life insurance policies issued to large employers.(2) For group accidental death and dismemberment insurance, a basic premium rate which the Office determines is consistent with the lowest rate generally charged for new group accidental death and dismemberment policies issued to large employers.The schedule for group life insurance, except as otherwise provided by this section, shall be applied to the distribution by age of the amounts of group life insurance under the policy at its date of issuance to determine an average basic premium rate per $1,000 of life insurance.(b) The policy shall provide that the basic premium rates determined for the first policy year continue for later policy years except as readjusted for a later year based on experience under the policy. The company issuing the policy may make the readjustment on a basis that the Office determines in advance of the policy year is consistent with the general practice of life insurance companies under policies of group life and group accidental death and dismemberment insurance issued to large employers.(c) The policy shall provide that if the Office determines that ascertaining the actual age distribution of the amounts of group life insurance in force at the date of issue of the policy or at the end of the first or any later year of insurance thereunder would not be possible except at a disproportionately high expense, the Office may approve the determination of a tentative average group life premium rate, for the first or any later policy year, instead of using the actual age distribution. The Office, on request by the com", "pany issuing the policy, shall redetermine the tentative average premium rate during any policy year, if experience indicates that the assumptions made in determining that rate were incorrect for that year.(d) The policy shall stipulate the maximum expense and risk charges for the first policy year. The Office shall determine these charges on a basis consistent with the general level of charges made by life insurance companies under policies of group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance issued to large employers. The maximum charges continue from year to year, except that the Office may redetermine them for any year either by agreement with the company issuing the policy or on written notice given to the company at least 1 year before the beginning of the year for which the redetermined maximum charges will be effective.(Pub.

The reserve shall bear interest at a rate determined in advance of each policy year by the company and approved by the Office as being consistent with the rates generally used by the company for similar funds held under other group life insurance policies. When the Office determines that the special contingency reserve has attained an amount estimated by it to make satisfactory provision for adverse fluctuations in future charges under the policy, any further excess shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Employees\u2019 Life Insurance Fund.

The preceding phrase \u201cof which\u201d eliminates the need for \u201cof\u201d after \u201cknowledge\u201d.In subsection (f)(3)(E), the words \u201cSecurities Exchange Act of 1934\u201d are substituted for \u201cSecurities and Exchange Act of 1934\u201d to correct an error in the law.

Title II of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 enacted a general amendment of title I of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (see section 202 at 103 Stat. 1724January 1, 1991section 13104(f)(4)(B) of title 5January 1, 1990section 3(10)(B) of Public Law 101\u2013280104 Stat. 157Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextFor the effective date of title II of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, referred to in subsec.
