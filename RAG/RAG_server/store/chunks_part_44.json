Short title; findings; purposes(a) Short titleThis chapter may be cited as the \u201cIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act\u201d.(b) Omitted(c) FindingsCongress finds the following:(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to participate in or contribute to society. Improving educational results for children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.(2) Before the date of enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94\u2013142(A) the children did not receive appropriate educational services;(B) the children were excluded entirely from the public school system and from being educated with their peers;(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the children from having a successful educational experience; or(D) a lack of adequate resources within the public school system forced families to find services outside the public school system.(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this chapter has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities and the families of such children access to a free appropriate public education and in improving educational results for children with disabilities.(4) However, the implementation of this chapter has been impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on applying re", "plicable research on proven methods of teaching and learning for children with disabilities.(5) Almost 30 years of research and experience has demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by\u2014(A) having high expectations for such children and ensuring their access to the general education curriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible, in order to\u2014(i) meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent possible, the challenging expectations that have been established for all children; and(ii) be prepared to lead productive and independent adult lives, to the maximum extent possible;(B) strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at school and at home;(C) coordinating this chapter with other local, educational service agency, State, and Federal school improvement efforts, including improvement efforts under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301(D) providing appropriate special education and related services, and aids and supports in the regular classroom, to such children, whenever appropriate;(E) supporting high-quality, intensive preservice preparation and professional development for all personnel who work with children with disabilities in order to ensure that such personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary to improve the academic achievement and functional performance of children with disabilities, including the use of scientifically based instructional practices, to the maximum extent possible;(F) providing incentives for whole-school approaches, scientifically based early reading programs, positive behavioral interventions and supports, and early intervening services to reduce the need to label children as disabled in order to address the learning and behavioral needs of such children;(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning while reducing paperwork and requirements that ", "do not assist in improving educational results; and(H) supporting the development and use of technology, including assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, to maximize accessibility for children with disabilities.(6) While States, local educational agencies, and educational service agencies are primarily responsible for providing an education for all children with disabilities, it is in the national interest that the Federal Government have a supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to educate children with disabilities in order to improve results for such children and to ensure equal protection of the law.(7) A more equitable allocation of resources is essential for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.(8) Parents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways.(9) Teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational outcomes.(10)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the growing needs of an increasingly diverse society.(B) America\u2019s ethnic profile is rapidly changing. In 2000, 1 of every 3 persons in the United States was a member of a minority group or was limited English proficient.(C) Minority children comprise an increasing percentage of public school students.(D) With such changing demographics, recruitment efforts for special education personnel should focus on increasing the participation of minorities in the teaching profession in order to provide appropriate role models with sufficient knowledge to address the special education needs of these students.(11)(A) The limited English proficient population is the fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in many parts of our Nation.(B) Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the levels of referral and placement of limited English prof", "icient children in special education.(C) Such discrepancies pose a special challenge for special education in the referral of, assessment of, and provision of services for, our Nation\u2019s students from non-English language backgrounds.(12)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.(B) More minority children continue to be served in special education than would be expected from the percentage of minority students in the general school population.(C) African-American children are identified as having intellectual disabilities and emotional disturbance at rates greater than their White counterparts.(D) In the 1998\u20131999 school year, African-American children represented just 14.8 percent of the population aged 6 through 21, but comprised 20.2 percent of all children with disabilities.(E) Studies have found that schools with predominately White students and teachers have placed disproportionately high numbers of their minority students into special education.(13)(A) As the number of minority students in special education increases, the number of minority teachers and related services personnel produced in colleges and universities continues to decrease.(B) The opportunity for full participation by minority individuals, minority organizations, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities in awards for grants and contracts, boards of organizations receiving assistance under this chapter, peer review panels, and training of professionals in the area of special education is essential to obtain greater success in the education of minority children with disabilities.(14) As the graduation rates for children with disabilities continue to climb, providing effective transition services to promote successful post-school employment or education is an important measure of accountability for children with disabilities.(d) PurposesThe purposes of this chapter are\u2014(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabi", "lities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs and prepare them for further education, employment, and independent living;(B) to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected; and(C) to assist States, localities, educational service agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of all children with disabilities;(2) to assist States in the implementation of a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families;(3) to ensure that educators and parents have the necessary tools to improve educational results for children with disabilities by supporting system improvement activities; coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology development and media services; and(4) to assess, and ensure the effectiveness of, efforts to educate children with disabilities.(Pub.

FindingsCongress finds the following:(1) The Federal Government has an ongoing obligation to support activities that contribute to positive results for children with disabilities, enabling those children to lead productive and ind", "ependent adult lives.(2) Systemic change benefiting all students, including children with disabilities, requires the involvement of States, local educational agencies, parents, individuals with disabilities and their families, teachers and other service providers, and other interested individuals and organizations to develop and implement comprehensive strategies that improve educational results for children with disabilities.(3) State educational agencies, in partnership with local educational agencies, parents of children with disabilities, and other individuals and organizations, are in the best position to improve education for children with disabilities and to address their special needs.(4) An effective educational system serving students with disabilities should\u2014(A) maintain high academic achievement standards and clear performance goals for children with disabilities, consistent with the standards and expectations for all students in the educational system, and provide for appropriate and effective strategies and methods to ensure that all children with disabilities have the opportunity to achieve those standards and goals;(B) clearly define, in objective, measurable terms, the school and post-school results that children with disabilities are expected to achieve; and(C) promote transition services and coordinate State and local education, social, health, mental health, and other services, in addressing the full range of student needs, particularly the needs of children with disabilities who need significant levels of support to participate and learn in school and the community.(5) The availability of an adequate number of qualified personnel is critical\u2014(A) to serve effectively children with disabilities;(B) to assume leadership positions in administration and direct services;(C) to provide teacher training; and(D) to conduct high quality research to improve special education.(6) High quality, comprehensive professional development programs are essential to ensure that the persons responsible for the edu", "cation or transition of children with disabilities possess the skills and knowledge necessary to address the educational and related needs of those children.(7) Models of professional development should be scientifically based and reflect successful practices, including strategies for recruiting, preparing, and retaining personnel.(8) Continued support is essential for the development and maintenance of a coordinated and high quality program of research to inform successful teaching practices and model curricula for educating children with disabilities.(9) Training, technical assistance, support, and dissemination activities are necessary to ensure that subchapters II and III are fully implemented and achieve high quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities and their families.(10) Parents, teachers, administrators, and related services personnel need technical assistance and information in a timely, coordinated, and accessible manner in order to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results at the State and local levels for children with disabilities and their families.(11) Parent training and information activities assist parents of a child with a disability in dealing with the multiple pressures of parenting such a child and are of particular importance in\u2014(A) playing a vital role in creating and preserving constructive relationships between parents of children with disabilities and schools by facilitating open communication between the parents and schools; encouraging dispute resolution at the earliest possible point in time; and discouraging the escalation of an adversarial process between the parents and schools;(B) ensuring the involvement of parents in planning and decisionmaking with respect to early intervention, educational, and transitional services;(C) achieving high quality early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;(D) providing such parents information on their rights,", " protections, and responsibilities under this chapter to ensure improved early intervention, educational, and transitional results for children with disabilities;(E) assisting such parents in the development of skills to participate effectively in the education and development of their children and in the transitions described in section 1473(b)(6) of this title(F) supporting the roles of such parents as participants within partnerships seeking to improve early intervention, educational, and transitional services and results for children with disabilities and their families; and(G) supporting such parents who may have limited access to services and supports, due to economic, cultural, or linguistic barriers.(12) Support is needed to improve technological resources and integrate technology, including universally designed technologies, into the lives of children with disabilities, parents of children with disabilities, school personnel, and others through curricula, services, and assistive technologies.(Pub.

Congressional findings(a) Dual school systems as denial of equal protection; depletion of financial resources of local educational agencies; transportation of students; inadequacy of guidelinesThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) the maintenance of dual school systems in which students are assigned to schools solely on the basis of race, color, sex, or national origin denies to those students the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment;(2) for the ", "purpose of abolishing dual school systems and eliminating the vestiges thereof, many local educational agencies have been required to reorganize their school systems, to reassign students, and to engage in the extensive transportation of students;(3) the implementation of desegregation plans that require extensive student transportation has, in many cases, required local educational agencies to expend large amounts of funds, thereby depleting their financial resources available for the maintenance or improvement of the quality of educational facilities and instruction provided;(4) transportation of students which creates serious risks to their health and safety, disrupts the educational process carried out with respect to such students, and impinges significantly on their educational opportunity, is excessive;(5) the risks and harms created by excessive transportation are particularly great for children enrolled in the first six grades; and(6) the guidelines provided by the courts for fashioning remedies to dismantle dual school systems have been, as the Supreme Court of the United States has said, \u201cincomplete and imperfect,\u201d and have not established, a clear, rational, and uniform standard for determining the extent to which a local educational agency is required to reassign and transport its students in order to eliminate the vestiges of a dual school system.(b) Necessity of Congress to specify appropriate remedies for elimination of dual school systemsFor the foregoing reasons, it is necessary and proper that the Congress, pursuant to the powers granted to it by the Constitution of the United States, specify appropriate remedies for the elimination of the vestiges of dual school systems, except that the provisions of this chapter are not intended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the United States to enforce fully the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States.(Pub.

The Federal Government is supporting these efforts in critical ways. The American Rescue Plan provides significant support to schools to develop and implement science-based health protocols to prevent the spread of COVID\u201319. Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is reimbursing States, including their school districts, at 100 percent Federal cost share to support the safe reopening and operation of school facilities and to effectively maintain the health and safety of students, educators, and staff.At the same time, however, some State governments have adopted policies and laws that interfere with the ability of schools and districts to keep our children safe during in-person learning. Some of these policies and laws have gone so far as to try to block school officials from adopting safety protocols alig", "ned with recommendations from the CDC to protect students, educators, and staff. And some State officials have even threatened to impose personal financial consequences on school officials who are working tirelessly to put student health and safety first and to comply with their legal obligations to their communities to further the essential goal of a safe, in-person education for all students.Our priority must be the safety of students, families, educators, and staff in our school communities.

No. 14045, Sept. 13, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyFrom advancements in science and civil and labor rights to leadership in government, advocacy, entrepreneurship, and business, the Hispanic community has had a profound and positive impact on our schools, our communities, our economy, and our Nation. Hispanic and Latino communities encompass many racial and cultural identities that span the globe. The diversity of Hispanic and Latino students makes our classrooms across the country rich learning environments. It is important to ensure that from early childhood to higher education, Hispanic and Latino students, including Dreamers, can reach their highest potential. For many Hispanic and Latino students, Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) provide critical pathways to opportunity, and hundreds of HSIs across our Nation are advancing intergenerational mobility, success, and opportunity.At the same time, Hispanic and Latino students face systemic ine", "quitable barriers in accessing a high-quality education and a fair shot at the American dream. Only 40 percent of Latino children participate in preschool education programs as compared to 53 percent of their White peers. Due to systemic and historical inequities faced in the classroom, the high school graduation rate for Hispanic students is below the national average. Hispanic students are underrepresented in advanced courses in mathematics and science, and they can face language barriers in the classroom. Only 19 percent of Latino adults have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree compared with 1 in 3 overall, and just 6 percent have completed graduate or professional degree programs, versus 13 percent nationally. Further, the lack of availability of adult continuing education courses makes it difficult for many Hispanic adults to further their education. In addition, barriers to equity in education can compound and intersect for Hispanic and Latino students who are women and girls, LGBTQ+ individuals, English language learners, and individuals with disabilities.The COVID\u201319 pandemic has laid bare and exacerbated many of these inequities. Hispanic and Latino students are more likely than their White peers to experience remote learning arrangements, yet they have less access to the tools necessary to succeed, such as broadband and computer access. Hispanic women have been adversely impacted by job loss, a lack of access to child care, and the inability to provide care, in greater numbers than their White counterparts. These and pre-existing disparities have led to declines in student achievement for Hispanic students. Latino students\u2014once the fastest-growing group of undergraduates in the United States\u2014have seen a decline in undergraduate college attendance amidst the COVID\u201319 pandemic. It is a priority of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID\u201319, and to provide Hispanic and Latino students with a successful return to the classroom.These barriers exist not simply in the classroom, but also in the w", "orkplace. Hispanic workers are overrepresented in industries that have been hit hardest by the COVID\u201319 pandemic, and they have faced disproportionate losses in employment. Hispanic and Latino workers often face discrimination in hiring, pay, and consideration for promotions among other challenges. They need greater access to work-based learning opportunities such as mentorships, internships, and registered apprenticeships that not only guide employment seekers to a career, but provide the experience needed to secure well-paying jobs.To ensure that our Nation reaches the ambitious goals we have set for our economy to thrive, as well as to ensure equal access to opportunity for all, we must enable Hispanic and Latino students to reach their highest potential through our Nation\u2019s schools and institutions of higher education. The Federal Government must also collaborate with Hispanic and Latino communities to ensure their long-term success.It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Hispanic communities from early childhood until their chosen career.Sec.White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics.(a) To advance equity in our Nation\u2019s schools and to promote the economic opportunity that follows it, there is established in the Department of Education (Department), the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Hispanics (Initiative), of which the Secretary of Education (Secretary) shall serve as Chair. The Secretary shall designate an Executive Director for the Initiative (Executive Director).(b) The Initiative shall advance educational equity and economic opportunity for Latino and Hispanic students, families, and communities by focusing on the following policy goals:(i) increasing general understanding of systemic causes of educational challenges faced by many Hispanic and Latino students, whether these students are in urban, suburban, ", "rural, or migrant learning environments, and working across Federal agencies to address these challenges;(ii) increasing Hispanic and Latino children\u2019s and families\u2019 access to and participation in high-quality early childhood programs and services that promote children\u2019s healthy development and learning, prepare them for success in school, and affirm their cultural and linguistic identity;(iii) addressing the inequitable treatment of Hispanic and Latino children, such as eradicating disparities in disciplinary actions;(iv) supporting and improving data collection related to Hispanic and Latino students and the implementation of evidence-based strategies to increase the participation and success of Hispanic and Latino students in all levels of education and prepare them for careers and civic engagement;(v) ensuring that all Hispanic and Latino students have access to excellent teachers, school leaders, and other professionals, including by supporting efforts to improve the recruitment, preparation, development, and retention of qualified, diverse teachers and school leaders and other professionals who understand students\u2019 lived experiences and can effectively meet their learning, social, and emotional needs;(vi) enhancing student support services and fostering positive engagement among schools, families, community leaders, and community-based organizations to increase the high school graduation and post-secondary attendance rates and decrease the high school dropout rate for Hispanic and Latino students;(vii) promoting a positive school climate that supports equitable access to and participation in college-readiness, advanced placement courses, and internship opportunities, as well as innovative dropout prevention and recovery strategies that better engage Hispanic and Latino youth in their learning, help them progress academically as needed, and provide those who have left the educational system with pathways to reentry;(viii) eliminating discriminatory enrollment, housing, transportation, and other policies that", " lead to racial and socioeconomic segregation among and within schools;(ix) ensuring equitable access to educational resources, professionals, and technology, including by addressing racial disparities in school funding and expenditures;(x) breaking down barriers that impede the access of higher education institutions that serve Hispanic and Latino students, such as HSIs, to Federal funding, and strengthening the capacity of those institutions to participate in Federal programs and partnerships;(xi) advancing racial equity and economic opportunity by connecting education to labor market needs through programs such as dual enrollment, career and technical education, registered apprenticeships, work-based learning, and career advancement, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;

No. 14050, Oct. 19, 2021By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicyBrown v. Board of EducationOver the course of America\u2019s history, Black Americans have helped to build, strengthen, and lead our Nation towards becoming a more perfect Union. Although for far too long, Black Americans were denied even the most basic access to education, the vital contributions of Black Americans in the fields of science, academia, business, and public service, among others, are a testament to the resilience of Black Americans and the steps our Nation has taken to expand access to education and opportunity.In spite of this progress, entrenched disparities continue to plague America\u2019s education system, holding far too many Black students back from achieving their full potential. Because of persistent racial and systemic injustices in our Nation, Black students remain more likely to attend high-poverty and racially segregated schools than White students. Black students are inequitably disciplined and suspended from school at disproportionately higher rates than White students for similar offenses. In addition, Black students too often face limited access to advanced and college-preparatory courses. Systemic racial disparities in education negatively impact learning outcomes for Black students and many face persistent gaps in reading and mathematics achievement. Studies show that school districts with high concentrations o", "f Black students are much more likely to be underfunded than districts where a majority of students are White, and face much wider funding gaps, with an average deficit of more than $5,000 per student. Black students are still below the national average for educational attainment in high school, and that gap is even higher for college attainment rates, as 26 percent of Black Americans ages 25 and older have attained a bachelor\u2019s degree, while the national average is 36 percent. Black students also face unique challenges at the intersection of race and gender. Barriers to equity in education can compound for Black students who are also LGBTQ+ students, English-language learners, Dreamers, or students with disabilities.These disparities result in long-standing college and postsecondary educational attainment gaps that affect life outcomes and access to opportunities. Although student populations are becoming increasingly diverse, Black teachers remain significantly underrepresented in our Nation\u2019s classrooms. Educational inequities have only widened throughout the COVID\u201319 pandemic, as Black students are more likely to experience remote learning challenges and greater learning loss as compared to their White peers. The persistent digital divide faced by some Black students has contributed to this disparity. It is a priority of my Administration to ensure an equitable recovery from COVID\u201319, and to provide all students with a successful return to the classroom.In the face of these historic and present-day inequities in our Nation\u2019s schools, Black students continue to persevere. Black students and scholars today are breaking the barriers confronted by generations who came before. Our Nation\u2019s schools and communities are irrefutably strengthened by the success, scholarship, and tenacity of Black students of all ages. But our Nation must go further to finally root out systemic barriers in our schools.Additionally, these barriers are present not just in the classroom, but also in the workplace. Black Americans face syst", "emic obstacles to getting good jobs, gaps in wages and promotion, and higher incidences of reported workplace discrimination than White workers. Eliminating these inequities requires expanding access to work-based learning and leadership opportunities, including mentorships, sponsorships, internships, and registered apprenticeships that provide not only career guidance, but also the experience needed to navigate and excel in successful careers. In order for our Nation to equitably recover from the COVID\u201319 crisis, and to ensure that every Black person in America has a fair shot at the American dream, we must advance equity and excellence in public education and access to economic opportunities.It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Black Americans and communities from early childhood until their chosen career.Sec.White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Black Americans(b) The Initiative shall advance educational equity and economic opportunity for Black students, families, and communities by focusing on the following policy goals:(i) increasing general understanding of systemic causes of educational challenges faced by many Black students, whether these students are in urban, suburban, rural, or migrant learning environments, and working across executive departments and agencies (agencies) to address these challenges;(ii) increasing Black children\u2019s and families\u2019 access to and participation in high-quality early childhood programs and services that promote children\u2019s healthy development and learning, prepare them for success in school, and affirm their cultural identity;(iii) addressing the inequitable treatment of Black children, such as eradicating discriminatory referrals to special education and excessive disciplinary actions;(iv) supporting and improving data collection related to Black students and the implementation of evidence-based strategies to increase the participation and suc", "cess of Black students in all levels of education and prepare them for careers and civic engagement;(v) ensuring that all Black students have access to excellent teachers, school leaders, and other professionals, including by supporting efforts to improve the recruitment, preparation, development, and retention of qualified, diverse teachers and school leaders and other professionals who understand students\u2019 lived experiences and can effectively meet their learning, social, and emotional needs;(vi) enhancing student support services and fostering positive engagement among schools, families, community leaders, and community-based organizations to increase the high school graduation and post-secondary attendance rates and decrease the high school dropout rate for Black students;(vii) promoting a positive school climate that supports equitable access to and participation in college-readiness, advanced placement courses, and internship opportunities, as well as innovative dropout prevention and recovery strategies that better engage Black youth in their learning, help them progress academically as needed, and provide those who have left the educational system with pathways to reentry;(viii) eliminating discriminatory enrollment, housing, transportation, and other policies that lead to racial and socioeconomic segregation among and within schools;(ix) ensuring equitable access to educational resources, professionals, and technology, including by addressing racial disparities in school funding and expenditures;(x) breaking down barriers that impede the access of higher education institutions that serve Black students, such as Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), to Federal funding, and strengthening the capacity of those institutions to participate in Federal programs and partnerships;(xi) advancing racial equity and economic opportunity by connecting education to labor market needs through programs such as dual enrollment, career and technical education, reg", "istered apprenticeships, work-based learning, and career advancement, particularly in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;

Ord. No. 14124. White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through Hispanic-Serving InstitutionsEx. Ord. No. 14124, July 17, 2024By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to advance equity in economic and educational opportunities, strengthen the capacity of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to provide a high-quality education, increase opportunities for these institutions to participate in and benefit from Federal programs, and ensure that HSIs can continue to be engines of educational opportunity and economic mobility, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPolicy20 U.S.C. 1101a(a)(5)Today, more than 500 HSIs, located in 27 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, serve more than 4.7 million students annually. Hispanic-Serving Institutions vary in size; support a range of academic interests; and serve urban, rural, and suburban communities", ". Over half of Hispanic and Latino postsecondary students in America attend an HSI, and nearly 40 percent of those students attend a 2-year HSI. Hispanic-Serving Institutions serve a significant number of students from low-income backgrounds. Students enrolled at HSIs account for approximately 30 percent of all Pell Grant recipients, even though these colleges and universities make up only 13 percent of all postsecondary degree-granting institutions. Further, HSIs can play a critical role in fostering diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. Notably, 69 percent of doctoral students in HSIs are enrolled in science- and engineering-related degrees, highlighting the significant role HSIs can play in ensuring a workforce that meets the Nation\u2019s evolving needs in technical fields.As Hispanic and Latino college enrollment has grown to historic levels over the last few decades, so has the number of HSIs, making HSIs\u2019 success vital to the strength of the Nation. These institutions are creating and implementing evidence-based practices that lead to Hispanic and Latino student success.Despite the fact that HSIs represent a large and fast-growing segment of the Nation\u2019s colleges and universities, per-student Federal funding at HSIs is 25 percent less than at other degree-granting institutions. Over the last 30 years, the number of HSIs has more than doubled and Hispanic or Latino student enrollment at HSIs has more than tripled. But per-student Federal funding at HSIs remains low compared to degree-granting institutions generally, and many HSIs report having unmet physical and digital infrastructure needs. This scarcity of resources often leaves HSIs at a disadvantage when compared with better-resourced institutions. Students, faculty, and staff at under-resourced HSIs often face challenges in accessing the resources they need to excel.Despite these funding disparities, research has shown that HSIs tend to do more for Hispanic and Latino student success than non-HSI colleges and universities\u2014an", "d do so with fewer resources. Many HSIs are leaders in promoting economic mobility for Hispanic and Latino students, including by closing college access, completion, and success gaps. Hispanic-Serving Institutions could further improve outcomes for students if they were adequately funded. The Federal Government must strengthen the capacity of HSIs to improve and expand their reach, while recognizing that HSIs face discrete challenges and opportunities that reflect their history and the communities they serve.As set forth in Executive Order 14045 of September 13, 2021It is the policy of my Administration to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity through strong partnerships with HSIs to ensure that they have access to Federal resources to help current and future generations of students succeed. The Federal Government must collaborate with HSIs and the students, families, and communities they serve to address and overcome barriers that may impede educational attainment and upward economic mobility. Strengthening the capacity of the Nation\u2019s HSIs is critical to fulfilling that objective.Sec.White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through Hispanic-Serving Institutions(b) The Initiative shall advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity through HSIs by focusing on the following goals:(i) identifying and promoting the availability of Federal programs and resources to enhance HSIs\u2019 educational capacity, including with respect to research and infrastructure development, while also breaking down barriers and expanding pathways for HSIs to access such programs and resources;(ii) identifying best practices for HSIs on developing, implementing, expanding, and sustaining strategies, programs, and initiatives that support the educational success and economic mobility of their students;(iii) improving the ability of HSIs to align their program offerings with the Nation\u2019s economic needs and promote opportunities for careers in criti", "cal professions, with an emphasis on increasing the number of students preparing for careers in in-demand and high-wage fields, such as science, technology, engineering, and math, as well as teaching, including bilingual and multilingual education;(iv) coordinating efforts to improve the fiscal security of HSIs;(v) developing new relationships, and fostering collaboration, among HSIs and philanthropic organizations, public- and private-sector organizations, elementary and secondary education providers, labor unions, and other entities to improve postsecondary affordability and degree attainment, pathways for students to enroll in HSIs, career preparation at HSIs, and employment opportunities that advance economic mobility for HSI students and graduates;(vi) strengthening Federal recruitment activities at HSIs to build accessible and equitable pathways into Federal career opportunities for HSI students, faculty, staff, and alumni;(vii) encouraging HSIs, as institutions that provide students with degrees that lead to upward economic mobility, to participate in Federal policymaking processes;(viii) encouraging the development of highly qualified, diverse, multilingual, and culturally responsive educators who support and instruct HSI students and contribute to effectively meeting those students\u2019 social, emotional, and academic needs; and(ix) providing data, tools, and analytics to support HSIs in improving educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for students.(c) On an annual basis, the Executive Director, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, shall report to the President on the Initiative\u2019s progress in carrying out its mission and function under this order.(d) The Executive Director shall meet regularly with HSI students, leaders, and other representatives to discuss matters related to the Initiative\u2019s mission and function.(e) The Department shall provide funding and administrative support for the Initiative to the extent permitted by law and within existing approp", "riations.

Biden, Jr.\nCreating and Expanding Ladders of Opportunity for Bo", "ys and Young Men of ColorMemorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 27, 2014Jan. 13, 2017Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and AgenciesOver the course of my Administration, we have made consistent progress on important goals such as reducing high school dropout rates and lowering unemployment and crime. Yet as the Congress, State and local governments, research institutions, and leading private-sector organizations have all recognized, persistent gaps in employment, educational outcomes, and career skills remain for many boys and young men of color throughout their lives.Many boys and young men of color will arrive at kindergarten less prepared than their peers in early language and literacy skills, leaving them less likely to finish school. Labor-force participation rates for young men of color have dropped, and far too many lack the skills they need to succeed. The disproportionate number of African American and Hispanic young men who are unemployed or involved in the criminal justice system undermines family and community stability and is a drag on State and Federal budgets. And, young men of color are far more likely to be victims of murder than their white peers, accounting for almost half of the country\u2019s murder victims each year. These outcomes are troubling, and they represent only a portion of the social and economic cost to our Nation when the full potential of so many boys and young men is left unrealized.By focusing on the critical challenges, risk factors, and opportunities for boys and young men of color at key life stages, we can improve their long-term outcomes and ability to contribute to the Nation\u2019s competiveness, economic mobility and growth, and civil society. Unlocking their full potential will benefit not only them, but all Americans.Therefore, I am establishing the Task Force on Improving the Lives of Boys and Young Men of Color and Underserved Youth, an interagency effort to improve measurably the expected educational and life outcomes for and address the persisten", "t opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color. The Task Force will help us determine the public and private efforts that are working and how to expand upon them, how the Federal Government\u2019s own policies and programs can better support these efforts, and how to better involve State and local officials, the private sector, and the philanthropic community.By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:SectionTask Force on Improving the Lives of Boys and Young Men of Color and Underserved Youth(i) the Attorney General;(ii) the Secretary of Agriculture;(iii) the Secretary of Commerce;(iv) the Secretary of Defense;(v) the Secretary of Education;(vi) the Secretary of Energy;(vii) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;(viii) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;(ix) the Secretary of the Interior;(x) the Secretary of Labor;(xi) the Secretary of Transportation;(xii) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget;(xiii) the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers;(xiv) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management;(xv) the Administrator of the Small Business Administration;(xvi) the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;(xvii) the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National and Community Service;(xviii) the Director of the National Science Foundation;(xix) the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement;(xx) the Director of the Domestic Policy Council;(xxi) the Director of the National Economic Council;(xxii) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy; and(xxiii) the heads of such other executive departments, agencies, and offices as the Chair may, from time to time, designate.(b) A member of the Task Force may designate a senior-level official who is from the member\u2019s department, agency, or office, and is a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government, to perform the day-to-day Task Force functions of the m", "ember. At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this subsection, as appropriate.(c) The Deputy Secretary of Education shall serve as Executive Director of the Task Force, determine its agenda, convene regular meetings of the Task Force, and supervise its work under the direction of the Chair. The Department of Education shall provide funding and administrative support for the Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. Each executive department or agency shall bear its own expenses for participating in the Task Force.SecMission and Function of the Task Force(i) develop a comprehensive public Web site, to be maintained by the Department of Education as appropriate, that will assess, on an ongoing basis and in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, including the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States, as appropriate, critical indicators of life outcomes for boys and young men of color (and other ethnic, income, and relevant subgroups) in absolute and relative terms;(ii) assess the impact of Federal policies, regulations, and programs of general applicability on boys and young men of color, so as to develop proposals that will enhance positive outcomes and eliminate or reduce negative ones;(iii) create an Administration-wide, online public portal to identify and disseminate successful programs and practices that improve outcomes for boys and young men of color;(iv) recommend, where appropriate, incentives for the broad adoption by national, State, and local public and private decisionmakers of effective and innovative strategies and practices for providing opportunities to and improving outcomes for boys and young men of color;(v) consistent with applicable privacy laws and regulations, provide relevant Federal data assets and expertise to public and private efforts to increase opportunities and improve life outcomes for boys and young men of color and un", "derserved youth, and explore ways to coordinate with State and local governments and non-governmental actors with useful data and expertise;(vi) ensure coordination with other Federal interagency groups and relevant public-private initiatives;(vii) work with external stakeholders to highlight the opportunities, challenges, and efforts affecting boys and young men of color and underserved youth; and(viii) recommend to the President means of ensuring sustained efforts within the Federal Government and continued partnership with the private sector and philanthropic community as set forth in this memorandum.(b) The Task Force shall focus on evidence-based intervention points and issues facing boys and young men of color up to the age of 25, with a particular focus on issues important to young men under the age of 15. Specifically, the Task Force shall focus on the following issues, among others: access to early childhood supports; grade school literacy; pathways to college and a career, including issues arising from school disciplinary action; access to mentoring services and support networks; and interactions with the criminal justice system and violent crime.(c) Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, each member of the Task Force shall provide recommended indicators of life outcomes for the public Web site described in subsection (a)(i) of this section, and a plan for providing data on such indicators.(d) Within 45 days of the date of this memorandum, each member of the Task Force shall identify any relevant programs and data-driven assessments within the member\u2019s department or agency for consideration in the portal described in subsection (a)(iii) of this section.(e) Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Task Force shall provide the President with a report on its progress and recommendations with respect to the functions set forth in subsection (a) of this section. Additionally, the Task Force shall provide, within 1 year of the date of this memorandum, a status report to the President regardi", "ng the implementation of this memorandum.(f) The Task Force shall also provide a status report to the President regarding the implementation of this memorandum at least once each calendar year. In addition, every 2 years, the Task Force shall review the recommendations from the 90-day report, determine whether updated recommendations should be sent to the President, and evaluate whether the set of critical indicators of life outcomes should be updated.SecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law or Executive Order to an agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(d) The Secretary of Education is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f3412.

Congressional statement of findings and purposes(a) The Congress finds that\u2014(1) exposure to asbestos fibers has been identified over a long period of time and by reputable medical and scientific evidence as significantly increasing the incidence of cancer and other severe or fatal diseases, such as asbestosis;(2) medical evidence has suggested that children may be particularly vulnerable to environmentally induced cancers;(3) medical science has not established any minimum level of exposure to asbestos fibers which is considered to be safe to individuals exposed to the fibers;(4) substantial amounts of asbestos, particularly in sprayed form, have been used in school buildings, especially during the period 1946 through 1972;(5) partial surveys in some States have indicated that (A) in a number of school buildings materials containing asbestos fibers have become damaged or friable, causing asbestos fibers to be dislodged into the air, and (B) asbestos concentrations far exceeding normal ambient air levels have been found in school buildings containing such damaged materials;(6) the presence in school buildings of friable or easily damaged asbestos creates an unwarranted hazard to the health of the school children and school employees who are exposed to such materials;(7) the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as several States, have attempted to publicize the potential hazards to school children and employees from exposure to asbestos fibers, but there is no systematic program for identifying hazardous conditions in schools or for remedying those conditions;(8) because there is no Federal health standard regulating", " the concentration of asbestos fibers in noncommercial workplace environments such as schools, school employees and students may be exposed to hazardous concentrations of asbestos fibers in the school buildings which they use each day;(9) without an improved program of information distribution, technical and scientific assistance, and financial support, many local educational agencies and States will not be able to mitigate the potential asbestos hazards in their schools; and(10) the effective regulation of interstate commerce for the protection of the public health requires the establishment of programs under this chapter to identify and mitigate hazards from exposure to asbestos fibers and materials emitting such fibers.(b) It is the purpose of this chapter to\u2014(1) direct the Secretary of Education to establish a task force to assist States and local educational agencies to ascertain the extent of the danger to the health of school children and employees from asbestos materials in schools;(2) require States receiving administrative funds for any applicable program (as defined under section 1221(c)(1)(A)\u202f11(3) provide scientific, technical, and financial assistance to State educational agencies and local educational agencies to enable them to conduct an asbestos detection program to identify asbestos hazards in schools;(4) provide loans to local educational agencies for the mitigation of asbestos hazards which constitute an imminent hazard to the health and safety of school children and employees; and(5) assure that no employee of any local educational agency suffers any disciplinary action as a result of calling attention to potential asbestos hazards which may exist in schools.(Pub.

Courses in Computer Science are especially scarce in too many schools and communities, despite the job opportunities that these skills create. Nearly 40 percent of high schools do not offer physics and 60 percent of high schools do not offer computer programming. Of the nearly 17,000 high schools that were accredited to offer Advanced Placement exams in 2015, only 18 percent were accredited to teach Advanced Placement Computer Science (AP\u2013CS). Minorities and students in rural communities often have even less access to Computer Science education. Nationwide, only 34 percent of African American students and 30 percent of rural high school students have access to a Computer Science class. Furthermore, even where classes are offered, there is a serious gender gap: less than a quarter of the students who took the AP\u2013CS A exam nationally in 2016 were girls.Shortages in high-quality STEM teachers at all levels, particularly in Computer Science, often drive these problems. The Department of Education, therefore, should prioritize helping districts recruit and train teachers capable of providing students with a rigorous education", " in STEM fields, focusing in particular on Computer Science. This will help equip students with the skills needed to obtain certifications and advanced degrees that ultimately lead to jobs in STEM fields.SecExpanding Access to Computer Science and STEM EducationEstablish promotion of high-quality STEM education, with a particular focus on Computer Science, as a Department of Education priority(b) Funding level(c) Explore administrative actions to promote Computer Science at the Department of Education(d) ReportSecDefinitionSecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the OMB Director relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(d) The Secretary is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nDonald J.

Findings and purpose(a) FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) exposure to asbestos fibers has been identified over a long period of time and by reputable medical and scientific evidence as significantly increasing the incidence of cancer and other severe or fatal diseases, such as asbestosis;(2) medical evidence has suggested that children may be particularly vulnerable to environmentally induced cancers;(3) medical science has not established any minimum level of exposure to asbestos fibers which is considered to be safe to individuals exposed to the fibers;(4) substantial amounts of asbestos, particularly in sprayed form, have been used in school buildings, especially during the period 1946 through 1972;(5) partial surveys in some States have indicated that (A) in a number of school buildings materials containing asbestos fibers have become damaged or friable, causing asbestos fibers to be dislodged into the air, and (B) asbestos concentration far exceeding normal ambient air levels have been found in school buildings containing such damaged materials;(6) the presence in school buildings of friable or easily damaged asbestos creates an unwarranted hazard to the health of the school children and school employees who are exposed to suc", "h materials;(7) the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as several States, have attempted to publicize the potential hazards to school children and employees from exposure to asbestos fibers, but there is no systematic program for remedying hazardous conditions in schools;(8) because there is no Federal health standard regulating the concentration of asbestos fibers in noncommercial workplace environments such as schools, school employees and students may be exposed to hazardous concentrations of asbestos fibers in the school buildings which they use each day;(9) without a program of information distribution, technical and scientific assistance, and financial support, many local educational agencies and States will not be able to mitigate the potential asbestos hazards in their schools; and(10) the effective regulation of interstate commerce for the protection of the public health requires the establishment of programs under this subchapter to mitigate hazards from exposure to asbestos fibers and materials emitting such fibers.(b) PurposeIt is the purpose of this subchapter to\u2014(1) direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to assist States and local educational agencies to ascertain the extent of the danger to the health of school children and employees from asbestos materials in schools;(2) provide continuing scientific and technical assistance to State and local agencies to enable them to identify and abate asbestos hazards in schools;(3) provide financial assistance for the abatement of asbestos threats to the health and safety of school children or employees; and(4) assure that no employee of any local educational agency suffers any disciplinary action as a result of calling attention to potential asbestos hazards which may exist in schools.(Pub.

L. 106\u201325, \u00a7\u202f2Apr. 29, 1999113 Stat. 41\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) States differ substantially in demographics, in school governance, and in school finance and funding. The administrative and funding mechanisms that help schools in one State improve may not prove successful in other States.\u201c(2) Although the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6301\u201c(3) By granting waivers of certain statutory and regulatory requirements, the Federal Government can remove impediments for local educational agencies in implementing educational reforms and raising the achievement levels of all children.\u201c(4) State educational agencies are closer to local school systems, implement statewide educational reforms with both Federal and State funds, and are responsible for maintaining accountability for local activities consistent with State standards and assessment systems. Therefore, State educational agencies are often in the best position to align waivers of Federal and State requirements with State and local initiatives.\u201c(5) The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act [former 20 U.S.C. 5891(e)\u201c(6) Expansion of waiver authority will allow for the waiver of statutory and regulatory requirements that impede implementation of State and local educational improvement plans, or that unnecessarily burden program administration, while maintaining the intent and purposes of affected programs, such as the important focus on improving mathematics a", "nd science performance under title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 6601\u201c(7) To achieve the State goals for the education of children in the State, the focus must be on results in raising the achievement of all students, not process.\u201d \u00a7\u202f5891b.

FindingsThe Congress finds as follows with respect to improving education in the United States:(1) A majority of public schools in the United States are failing to prepare students to achieve the National Education Goals. The Federal Government should support an extensive program of educational research, development, dissemination, replication and assistance to identify and support the best responses for the challenges ahead. A significant investment in attaining a deeper understanding of the processes of learning and schooling and developing new ideas holds the best hope of making a substantial difference to the lives of every student in the United States. The Office of Educational Research and Improvement within the Department of Education should be at the center of this campaign in order to coordinate such efforts.(2) The Federal role in educational research has been closely identified with youths who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, are minorities, belong to a language minority, or have a disability. The Federal commitment to education was sufficient to serve not more than\u2014(A) in 1993, 1 out of every 6 low-income children in need of preschool education;(B) in 1990, 3 out of every 5 children in need of remediation;(C) in 1991, 1 out of every 5 children in need of bilingual education; and(D) in 1992, 1 out of every 20 youths eligible for assistance under the Job Training Partnership Act.(3) The failure of the Federal Government to adequately invest in educational research and devel", "opment has denied the United States a sound foundation of knowledge on which to design school improvements. The educational achievement of minority children is of particular concern because at least half of the public school students in 25 of the largest cities of the United States are minority children, and demographers project that, by the year 2005, almost all urban public school students will be minority children or other children in poverty.(4) The investment goal of the Federal research, development, and dissemination function should be at least 1 percent of the total amount of funds spent on education.(5) Nationwide model programs and reliable interventions should be demonstrated and replicated, and for such purposes, programs should be established to conduct research and evaluations, and to disseminate information.(6) The Office should develop a national dissemination policy that will advance the goal of placing a national treasure chest of research results, models, and materials at the disposal of the education decisionmakers of the United States.(7) A National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board should be established to work collaboratively with the Assistant Secretary to forge a national consensus with respect to a long-term agenda for educational research, development, dissemination, and the activities of the Office.(8) Existing research and development entities should adopt expanded, proactive roles and new institutions should be created to promote knowledge development necessary to accelerate the application of research findings to high priority areas.(9) Greater use should be made of existing technologies in efforts to improve the educational system of the United States, including efforts to disseminate research findings.(10) Minority educational researchers are inadequately represented throughout the Department of Education, but particularly in the Office. The Office therefore should assume a leadership position in the recruitment, retention, and promotion of qualified minority educat", "ional researchers.(11) The coordination of the mission of the Office with that of other components of the Department of Education is critical. The Office should improve the coordination of the educational research, development, and dissemination function with those of other Federal agencies.(Pub.
