As a step in that direction, in future negotiations, the United States should work toward aggregate contributio", "ns to future replenishments to international financial institutions covered by this Act not to exceed 25 per centum.(b) Funding commitments to international financial institutions; availability of funds subject to appropriationsThe Congress recognizes that economic development is a long-term process needing funding commitments to international financial institutions.

Financial assistan", "ce to international financial institutions; considerations and criteria(a) Congressional declaration of intentUnited States active participation in international financial institution activity is based on our national objective of furthering the economic and social development of the nations of the world, in particular the developing nations. The attainment of this national objective is most effectively realized through a world economic and financial system which is both free and stable. Therefore, it is the intent of the United States Congress that United States financial assistance to the international financial institutions should be primarily directed to those projects that would not generate excess commodity supplies in world markets, displace private investment initiatives or foster departures from a market-oriented economy.(b) Effect of country adjustment programs; minimization of projected adverse impacts; avoidance of government subsidizationThe Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the representatives of the United States to the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) to take into account in their review of loans, credits, or other utilization of the resources of their respective institutions, the effect that country adjustment programs would have upon individual industry sectors and international commodity markets in order to\u2014(1) minimize any projected adverse impacts on such sector or markets of making such loans, credits, or utilization of resources; and(2) avoid whenever possible government subsidization of production and exports of international commodities without regard to economic conditions in the markets for such commodities.(c) Project proposals relating to mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal productsMore specifically, the following criteria should be considered as a basis for a vote by the respective United States Executive Director to each of the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) against a project propo", "sal involving the creation of new capacity or the expansion, improvement, or modification of mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products:(1) Analysis shows that the risks, returns, and incentives of a project are such that it could be financed at reasonable terms by commercial lending services.(2) Analysis by the United States Bureau of Mines indicates that surplus capacity in the industry for the primary product of the defined project would exist over half the period of the economic life of the project because of projected world demand and capacity conditions.(3) United States imports of the commodity constitute less than 50 percent of the domestic production of the primary product in those cases where the United States is the substantial producer of such commodities.(d) International financial institutionsThe international financial institutions referred to in subsections (a) and (b) are the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank.(Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis title may be cited as the \u2018Preventing Child Marriage in Displaced Populations Act\u2019.\u201cSEC. 402. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) According to United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), 12,000,000 girls marry before the age of 18 every year.\u201c(2) Early marriage denies children, especially girls, their right to make vital decisions about their well-being, including relating to their health, family, and career. Child brides are less likely to finish their education, and are at higher risk for abuse, contracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or giving birth.\u201c(3) Child marriage also imposes substantial economic costs to developing countries, impeding development and prosperity gains.\u201c(4) Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to child marriage, in communities where poverty, instability, and displacement put pressure on families to marry children, particularly young girls, off at a young age.\u201c(5) One United Nations (UN) study found that child marriage rates were 4 times higher among displaced Syrian refugees than among Syrians before the crisis. This indicates that displacement, instability, and poverty are driving child marriages.\u201c(6) United Nations agencies, including UNICEF and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have acknowledged the dangers of child marriage and taken steps to address its risk in the populations they serve.\u201c(7) The UN Joint Program on Child Marriage supports this work by building the resilience of populations to indirectly prevent child marriage and by generating new data and evidence on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian and fragile settings. For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adolescent girls strengthen critical skills through school clubs and Go Back to School campaigns, as well as life skills and financial literacy training.\u201c(8) After the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage identified Yemen as one of its focus countri", "es, 65,000 people, of whom 45,000 are adolescents, were reached with awareness-raising activities on the harms of child marriage in 2018 alone. As a result, local council representatives, elders, and community leaders from 6 districts signed a pledge to support advocacy efforts to end child marriage.\u201cSEC. 403. PREVENTING CHILD MARRIAGE IN DISPLACED POPULATIONS.\u201c(a) In GeneralThe President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to call for an adoption of an agreed upon definition of \u2018child marriage\u2019 across United Nations agencies.\u201c(b) StrategyThe President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the United Nations to call for the development of a comprehensive strategy to address child marriage in refugee settlements administered by the United Nations. The strategy should include the following elements:\u201c(1) A mandate to regularly collect and report data related to the number of known or suspected child marriages taking place inside each such settlement.\u201c(2) Protocols for United Nations personnel regarding prevention and monitoring of child marriages inside each such settlement.\u201c(3) A description of United Nations programs administered at such settlements that include\u2014\u201c(A) physical, mental, and emotional rehabilitation and support to children who have extricated themselves from child marriage; and\u201c(B) alternatives to child marriage, such as education initiatives.\u201c(4) Protocols regarding how United Nations personnel should\u2014\u201c(A) report adults participating in illegal child marriages in each such settlement; and\u201c(B) monitor the prosecution of such adults by the authorities of the country in which the settlement at issue is located.\u201c(c) ResearchThe President shall direct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the Uni", "ted Nations to advocate for the United Nations and its appropriate agencies to include, as appropriate, in all of its research regarding child marriage, the relationship between child marriage and violence against girls, including young children and infants.\u201c(d) DefinitionsIn this section:\u201c(1) Child marriageThe term \u2018child marriage\u2019 means a formal marriage or informal union involving at least one person younger than age 18.\u201c(2) Illegal child marriageThe term \u2018illegal child marriage\u2019 means a child marriage that is illegal under the laws of the country in which the child marriage occurs.\u201dRestriction on Funding for the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty OrganizationPub.

FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) According to United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), 12,000,000 girls marry before the age of 18 every year.\u201c(2) Early marriage denies children, especially girls, their right to make vital decisions about their well-being, including relating to their health, family, and career. Child brides are less likely to finish their education, and are at higher risk for abuse, contracting HIV, and dying while pregnant or giving birth.\u201c(3) Child marriage also imposes substantial economic costs to developing countries, impeding development and prosperity gains.\u201c(4) Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to child marriage, in communities where poverty, instability, and displacement put pressure on families to marry children, particularly young girls, off at a young age.\u201c(5) One United Nations (UN) study found that child marriage rates were 4 times higher among displaced Syrian refugees than", " among Syrians before the crisis. This indicates that displacement, instability, and poverty are driving child marriages.\u201c(6) United Nations agencies, including UNICEF and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), have acknowledged the dangers of child marriage and taken steps to address its risk in the populations they serve.\u201c(7) The UN Joint Program on Child Marriage supports this work by building the resilience of populations to indirectly prevent child marriage and by generating new data and evidence on the prevalence of child marriage in humanitarian and fragile settings. For example, in Uganda, the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage helped 27,000 adolescent girls strengthen critical skills through school clubs and Go Back to School campaigns, as well as life skills and financial literacy training.\u201c(8) After the UN Joint Program on Child Marriage identified Yemen as one of its focus countries, 65,000 people, of whom 45,000 are adolescents, were reached with awareness-raising activities on the harms of child marriage in 2018 alone. As a result, local council representatives, elders, and community leaders from 6 districts signed a pledge to support advocacy efforts to end child marriage. \u201cSEC. 403.

adopted a freeze on the hiring of personnel within the United Nations Secretariat.\u201c(2) The conditions of the freeze were such that, as", " the terms of office for the personnel expired, replacements would not be recruited or hired to fill the vacant positions, with minor exceptions.\u201c(3) The freeze was designed to reduce United Nations personnel by 15 percent over three years, as recommended by the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations (commonly referred to as the \u2018Group of 18 Experts\u2019).\u201c(4) On May 5, 1987\u201c(5) Of these 156 probable exceptions, 104 would be Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat\u2014of 298 Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat\u2014who would be replaced over the next 18 months.\u201c(6) According to a report from the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on \u2018Soviet Presence in the United Nations Secretariat\u2019 (Senate Print 99\u201352, May 1985), approximately one-fourth of the Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat are intelligence officers, many more are co-opted by the Soviet intelligence agencies, and all Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat must respond to KGB requests for assistance.\u201c(7) Other United States intelligence authorities estimate that as many as one-half of the Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals in the United Nations Secretariat are officers of the KGB or the GRU.\u201c(8) If the Secretary-General\u2019s probable exemptions are adopted, the Soviet Union will be allowed to replace retiring Soviet and Soviet-bloc personnel with new, highly skilled and well-trained intelligence officers of the KGB or the GRU.\u201c(9) The Secretary-General\u2019s proposed exceptions would thus provide the Soviet Union with the capability to rebuild its intelligence apparatus within the United States, which was devastated in recent years when the United States ordered severe reductions in the size of the Soviet mission to the United Nations, the Soviet Embassy in Washington, District of Columbia, and the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, California.\u201c(10) Article 100 o", "f the United Nations Charter calls for the establishment of an international civil service whose members are neutral and loyal only to the United Nations.\u201c(11) Section 3 of Article 101 of the United Nations Charter calls for the appointment of individuals who are professionally qualified for the positions they are to fill and maintains that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.\u201c(12) As of September 1985, 442 of 446 Soviet nationals employed throughout the United Nations system are \u2018seconded\u2019, that is, serve on short, fixed-term contracts.\u201c(13) Through the abuse of short, fixed-term contracts, the Soviet Union has maintained undue influence and control over major offices of the United Nations Secretariat, thereby effectively using the United Nations Secretariat in the conduct of its foreign relations, in clear violation of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter.\u201c(14) The Secretary-General\u2019s proposed exceptions to the hiring freeze (as described in paragraphs (1) through (5)) would continue the gross violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter described in paragraph (13).\u201c(15) The Secretary-General\u2019s proposed exceptions to such hiring freeze would be clearly inconsistent with the terms of the United Nation\u2019s self-imposed reform program.\u201c(16) The United Nations has not yet achieved its reform goals and there is no indication that the United Nations can afford to make such large exceptions to such hiring freeze.\u201c(b) Sense of the CongressIt is the sense of the Congress that\u2014\u201c(1) the President should take all such actions necessary to ensure compliance with the hiring freeze rule, including withholding all assessed United States contributions to the United Nations, and denying United States entry visas to Soviet and Soviet-bloc applicants coming to the United States to replace Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently serving in the United Nations Secretariat;\u201c(2) the President, through the Department of State an", "d the United States mission to the United Nations, should express to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the insistence of the American people that the hiring freeze continue indefinitely, or until the United Nations has complied with the Group of 18 recommendations and can thus afford to make exceptions to the freeze;\u201c(3) the Secretary-General should revoke all exceptions to the hiring freeze rule, excepting those member-nations which have 15 or fewer nationals serving in the United Nations Secretariat, or those positions not subject to geographical representation, such as those of the general service category;\u201c(4) the long-term, flagrant violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter and the abuse of secondment by the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc member-nations are reprehensible;\u201c(5) the United Nations should adopt the recommendations of the Group of 18 (as referred to in subsection (a)(3)) that no member-nation be allowed to have more than 50 percent of its nationals employed under fixed-term contracts;\u201c(6) the Soviet Union is hereby condemned for\u2014\u201c(A) its refusal to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter calling for an international civil service,\u201c(B) its abuse of secondment, and\u201c(C) its absolute disregard of the solemn purpose of the United Nations to be an international civil service; and\u201c(7) if the Soviet Union and the Soviet-bloc intend to remain member-nations of the United Nations, they should adhere to Articles 100, 101, and all other principles of the United Nations Charter to which every other member-nation must adhere.\u201c(c) DefinitionFor the purposes of this section, the

My reasons for proposing this plan are stated in another message transmitted to the Congress today.After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 19", "49, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of officers specified in section 1 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.I expect that the improved organizational arrangement provided for in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 will lead to substantial economies and significantly improved effectiveness of administration. It is not practicable, however, to itemize at this time the reductions in expenditures which will probably be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the reorganization plan.\nDwight D.

I am also acting pursuant to section 501 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1978 (Public Law 95\u2013105October 31, 1977This reorganization will consolidate into a new agency, to be known as the Agency for International Communication, the functions now exercised by the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the United States Information Agency.The principal aspects of this proposal are:\u2014The new agency will take over USIA\u2019s international communications programs (including the Voice of America) and the international educational and cultural exchange activities now conducted by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.\u2014The", " agency\u2019s Director will be the principal advisor on international information and exchange activities to the President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of State. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, the Director will have primary responsibility within the Government for the conduct of such activities. The Director, the Deputy Director and the Associate Directors of the new agency will be confirmed by the Senate.\u2014The two commissions that now advise USIA and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs will be combined into a single seven-member commission. Members of this nonpartisan commission will be chosen from fields related to the agency\u2019s mission. The commissioners will be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.The purpose of this reorganization is to broaden our informational, educational and cultural intercourse with the world, since this is the major means by which our government can inform others about our country, and inform ourselves about the rest of the world.The new Agency for International Communication will play a central role in building these two-way bridges of understanding between our people and the other peoples of the world. Only by knowing and understanding each other\u2019s experiences can we find common ground on which we can examine and resolve our differences.The new agency will have two distinct but related goals:To tell the world about our society and policies\u2014in particular our commitment to cultural diversity and individual liberty.To tell ourselves about the world, so as to enrich our own culture as well as to give us the understanding to deal effectively with problems among nations.As the world becomes more and more interdepend\u00adent, such mutual understanding becomes increasingly vital. The aim of this reorganization, therefore, is a more effective dialogue among peoples of the earth. Americans\u2014mostly immigrants or the descendants of immigrants\u2014are particularly well suited to enter into such an undertaking. We have already learned much from th", "ose who have brought differing values, perspectives and experiences to our shores. And we must continue to learn.Thus the new agency will lay heavy emphasis on listening to others, so as to learn something of their motivations and aspirations, their histories and cultures.Several principles guided me in shaping this reorganization plan. Among the most important were:\u2014Maintaining the integrity of the educational and cultural exchange programs is imperative. To this end, the plan retains the Board of Foreign Scholarships, whose strong leadership has done so much to insure the high quality of the educational exchange program. In addition, I intend to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of educational and cultural functions consolidated in the new Agency. The responsibilities presently exercised by the Department of State in relation to the Center for Technical and Cultural Interchange Between East and West, Inc., will be transferred to the new agency without alteration.\u2014Keeping the Voice of America\u2019s news gathering and reporting functions independent and objective. The Voice\u2019s charter, enacted into law in 1976, provides that \u201cVOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive\u201d; that VOA will \u201cpresent a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions\u201d; and that VOA will present U.S. policies \u201cclearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussion and opinion on these policies.\u201d Under this Administration, VOA will be solely responsible for the content of news broadcasts\u2014for there is no more valued coin than candor in the international marketplace of ideas. I also plan to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of the Voice of America.\u2014The new agency\u2019s activities must be straightforward, open, candid, balanced, and representative. They will not be given over to the advancement of the views of any one group, any one party or any one Administration. The", " agency must not operate in a covert, manipulative, or propagandistic way.\u2014Rights of U.S. Information Agency and State Department employees must be respected. In the new agency, their career achievements will be recognized and the best possible use made of their professional skills and abilities.The Director of the new agency will assess and advise on the impact on worldwide public opinion of American foreign policy decisions. The Agency will coordinate the international information, educational, cultural and exchange programs conducted by the U.S. Government and will be a governmental focal point for private U.S. international exchange programs. It will also play a leading role within the U.S. Government in our efforts to remove barriers to the international exchange of ideas and information.It is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies that will result from the proposed reorganization, and therefore I do not do so. The reorganization will result in greater efficiency by unifying in Washington the management of programs which are already administered in a consolidated manner in the field. For example, field officers will no longer report to two separate sets of supervisors and headquarters at home.This plan abolishes the functions of the Advisory Committee on the Arts authorized by section 106(c) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2456(c)22 U.S.C. 146822 U.S.C. 1467(a)Various obsolete or superseded functions under Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 (22 U.S.C. 146122 U.S.C. 2670(e)section 903(b) of title 5After investigation, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to carry out the policy set forth in section 901(a) of title 5In presenting this plan, I ask the support of Congress to strengthen and simplify the machinery by which we carry out these important functions of the United States Government.Such action will make us better able to project the great variety and vitality of American life to those abroad, and to", " enrich our own lives with a fuller knowledge of the vitality and variety of other societies.The new Agency for International Communication will help us demonstrate \u201ca decent respect for the opinions of mankind,\u201d and to deal intelligently with a world awakening to a new spirit of freedom.\nJimmy Carter.The White HouseOctober 11, 1977\nEx.

The United States International Television Service news will be accurate and objective.(2) The United States International Television Service will represent the United States, not any single segment of American society and will, therefore, present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.(3) The United States International Television Service will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.(c) ProgramsThe Broadcasting Board of Governors is authorized to produce, acquire, or broadcast television programs, via satellite, only if such programs\u2014(1) are interactive, consisting of interviews among participants in different locales;(2) cover news, public affairs, or other current events;(3) cover official activities of government, Federal or State, including congressional proceedings and news briefings of any agency of the Executive branch; or(4) are of an artistic or scientific character or are otherwise representative of American culture.(d) CostsWhen a comparable program produced by United States public or commercial broadcasters and producers is available at a cost which is equal to or less than the cost of production by the United States International Television Service, the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall use such materials in preference to the United States International Television Service produced materials.(e) Allocation of funds(1) Of the funds authorized to be appropriated to the Broadcasting Board of Governors not more than $12,000,000 for the fiscal year 1990 and not more than $12,480,000", " for the fiscal year 1991 may be obligated or expended for the United States International Television Service.(2) The Broadcasting Board of Governors shall prepare and submit to the Congress quarterly reports which contain a detailed explanation of expenditures for the United States International Television Service during the fiscal years 1990 and 1991. Such reports shall contain specific justification and supporting information pertaining to all programs, particularly those described in subsection (c)(4), that were produced in-house by the United States International Television Service.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016\u2019.\u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) It is estimated that the Nazis confiscated or otherwise misappropriated hundreds of thousands of works of art and other property throughout Europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the Jewish people and other persecuted groups. This has been described as the \u2018greatest displacement of art in human history\u2019.\u201c(2) Following World War II, the United States and its allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their countries of origin. Despite these efforts, many works of art were never reunited with their owners. Some of the art has since been discovered in the United States.\u201c(3) In 1998, the United States convened a conference with 43 other nations in Washington, DC, known as the Washington Conference, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. One of these principles is that \u2018steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution\u2019 to claims involving such art that has not been restituted if the owners or their heirs can be identified.\u201c(4) The same year, Congress enacted the Holocaust Victims Redress Act (Public Law 105\u2013158112 Stat. 15\u201c(5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art and urged all participants \u2018to ensure that their legal systems or alterna", "tive processes, while taking into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all parties.\u2019. The Declaration also urged participants to \u2018consider all relevant issues when applying various legal provisions that may impede the restitution of art and cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where appropriate under law.\u2019.\u201c(6) Victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs have taken legal action in the United States to recover Nazi-confiscated art. These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar claims within some limited number of years from either the date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06\u201310333, 2007 WL 1016996 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007\u201c(7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court that has considered the question held that the Constitution prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law that extended the State statute of limitations for claims seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the Federal Government\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a Federal law is necessary to ensure that claims to Nazi-confiscated art are adjudicated in ac", "cordance with United States policy as expressed in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration.\u201c(8) While litigation may be used to resolve claims to recover Nazi-confiscated art, it is the sense of Congress that the private resolution of claims by parties involved, on the merits and through the use of alternative dispute resolution such as mediation panels established for this purpose with the aid of experts in provenance research and history, will yield just and fair resolutions in a more efficient and predictable manner.\u201cSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\u201cThe purposes of this Act are the following:\u201c(1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi-confiscated art and other property further United States policy as set forth in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration.\u201c(2) To ensure that claims to artwork and other property stolen or misappropriated by the Nazis are not unfairly barred by statutes of limitations but are resolved in a just and fair manner.\u201cSEC. 4.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act of 2016\u2019. \u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) It is estimated that the Nazis confiscated or otherwise misappropriated hundreds of thousands of works of art and other property throughout Europe as part of their genocidal campaign against the Jewish people and other persecuted groups. This has been described as the \u2018greatest displacement of art in human history\u2019.\u201c(2) Following World War II, the United States and its allies attempted to return the stolen artworks to their countries of origin. Despite these efforts, many works of art were never reunited with their owners. Some of the art has since been discovered in the United States.\u201c(3) In 1998, the United States convened a conference with 43 other nations in Washington, DC, known as the Washington Conference, which produced Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art. One of these principles is that \u2018steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution\u2019 to claims involving such art that has n", "ot been restituted if the owners or their heirs can be identified.\u201c(4) The same year, Congress enacted the Holocaust Victims Redress Act (Public Law 105\u2013158112 Stat. 15\u201c(5) In 2009, the United States participated in a Holocaust Era Assets Conference in Prague, Czech Republic, with 45 other nations. At the conclusion of this conference, the participating nations issued the Terezin Declaration, which reaffirmed the 1998 Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art and urged all participants \u2018to ensure that their legal systems or alternative processes, while taking into account the different legal traditions, facilitate just and fair solutions with regard to Nazi-confiscated and looted art, and to make certain that claims to recover such art are resolved expeditiously and based on the facts and merits of the claims and all the relevant documents submitted by all parties.\u2019. The Declaration also urged participants to \u2018consider all relevant issues when applying various legal provisions that may impede the restitution of art and cultural property, in order to achieve just and fair solutions, as well as alternative dispute resolution, where appropriate under law.\u2019.\u201c(6) Victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs have taken legal action in the United States to recover Nazi-confiscated art. These lawsuits face significant procedural obstacles partly due to State statutes of limitations, which typically bar claims within some limited number of years from either the date of the loss or the date that the claim should have been discovered. In some cases, this means that the claims expired before World War II even ended. (See, e.g., Detroit Institute of Arts v. Ullin, No. 06\u201310333, 2007 WL 1016996 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 31, 2007\u201c(7) Federal legislation is needed because the only court that has considered the question held that the Constitution prohibits States from making exceptions to their statutes of limitations to accommodate claims involving the recovery of Nazi-confiscated art. In Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of", " Art, 592 F.3d 954 (9th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit invalidated a California law that extended the State statute of limitations for claims seeking recovery of Holocaust-era artwork. The Court held that the law was an unconstitutional infringement of the Federal Government\u2019s exclusive authority over foreign affairs, which includes the resolution of war-related disputes. In light of this precedent, the enactment of a Federal law is necessary to ensure that claims to Nazi-confiscated art are adjudicated in accordance with United States policy as expressed in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration.\u201c(8) While litigation may be used to resolve claims to recover Nazi-confiscated art, it is the sense of Congress that the private resolution of claims by parties involved, on the merits and through the use of alternative dispute resolution such as mediation panels established for this purpose with the aid of experts in provenance research and history, will yield just and fair resolutions in a more efficient and predictable manner. \u201cSEC. 3. PURPOSES.\u201cThe purposes of this Act are the following:\u201c(1) To ensure that laws governing claims to Nazi-confiscated art and other property further United States policy as set forth in the Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art, the Holocaust Victims Redress Act, and the Terezin Declaration.\u201c(2) To ensure that claims to artwork and other property stolen or misappropriated by the Nazis are not unfairly barred by statutes of limitations but are resolved in a just and fair manner. \u201cSEC. 4.

In 1952, the Commission was assigned, additionally, the administration of claims of Philippine religious organizations which sustained losses of their educational, medical, and welfare facilities in the war, and of benefits to United States prisoners of war for inhumane treatment during internment by the enemy.From its inception in 1949 to April 1, 1954March 31, 1955The International Claims Commission was established within the Department of State by the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949. Its immediate function was to adjudicate claims covered by a settlement of $17 million which was deposited with the Government of the United States by the Yugoslav Government primarily to compensate our nationals for losses s", "ustained through nationalization of properties. The act also authorized the Commission to settle such claims as might be included later in any similar agreement between the United States and a foreign government. Subsequently, the Commission was assigned the administration of a $400,000 settlement negotiated with the Government of Panama.From its establishment in 1950 to April 1, 1954December 31, 1954The accompanying reorganization plan has substantial potential advantages. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission will be able to administer any additional claims programs financed by funds derived from foreign governments without the delay which has often characterized the initiation of past programs. Moreover, the use of an existing agency will be more economical than the establishment of a new commission to administer a given type of foreign claims program. Consolidation of the affairs of the two present Commissions will also permit the retention and use of the best experience gained during the last several years in the field of claims settlement. The declining workload of current programs can be meshed with the rising workload of new programs with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.A proposed new claims program now pending before the Senate would provide benefits similar to those paid to World War II victims under the War Claims Act for losses and internments resulting from hostilities in Korea. The executive branch of the Government has recommended approval of this program by the Congress. I now suggest that this program be assigned by law to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.There should also be assigned to this new Commission the settlement of such of the claims programs as may be authorized from among those recommended by the War Claims Commission in its report made pursuant to section 8 of the War Claims Act. That report, posing many complex policy, legal, and administrative problems, is now being reviewed by executive agencies; and recommendations will soon be sent to the Congress.By peace treati", "es and an international agreement, the United States has acquired the right to utilize certain external assets and settlement funds of several countries. A total of about $39 million is available to indemnify claims of United States nationals against the Governments of Rumania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Italy, arising out of war damage or confiscations in those countries. In addition, claims growing out of United States losses from default on obligations and nationalization of properties may be settled by awards from $9 million realized from an agreement made in 1933 with the Soviet Union, known as the Litvinov assignment. Action by the Congress is necessary before these various funds may be assigned for settlement, and recommendations of the executive branch in this connection will be transmitted at an early date.In addition to the reorganizations I have described, the reorganization plan transfers to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission the functions of the Commissioner provided for in the joint resolution of August 4, 1939The reorganization plan does not transfer the war claims fund or the Yugoslav claims fund from the Department of the Treasury, or divest the Secretary of the Treasury of any functions under the War Claims Act of 1948, as amended, or under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, as amended. It does not limit the responsibility of the Secretary of State with respect to the conduct of foreign affairs. The reorganizations contained in the reorganization plan will not prejudice any interest or potential interest of any claimant.After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of officers ", "specified in section 1 of the plan. The rate of compensation fixed for each of these officers is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.The statutory citation for certain functions of the Secretary of State with respect to the International Claims Commission which are abolished by the reorganization plan, is the third and fourth sentences of section 3(c) of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 (64 Stat. 13It is at this time impracticable to specify the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations contained in the plan.Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1954 provides a single agency for the orderly completion of present claims programs. In addition, it provides an effective organization for the settlement of future authorized claims programs by utilizing the experience gained by present claims agencies. It provides unified administrative direction of the functions concerned, and it simplifies the organizational structure of the executive branch. I urge that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.\nDwight D. Eisenhower.The White HouseApril 29, 1954 \u00a7\u202f1622a.

Witnesses summoned before the Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States. In case of disobedience to a subpena, the aid of any district court of the United States, as constituted by chapter 5 of title 28, and the United States court of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States may be invoked in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of such books, papers, documents, records, correspondence, and other evidence. Any such court within the jurisdiction of which the inquiry or hearing is carried on may, in case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena issued to any person, issue an order requiring such person to appear or to give evidence touching the matter in question; and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.(d) DepositionsThe Commission may order testimony to be taken by deposition in any ", "inquiry or hearing pending before it at any stage of such proceeding or hearing.
