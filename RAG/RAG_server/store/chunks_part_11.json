Economy and Efficiency in Government Procurement Through Compliance with Certain Immigration and Nationality Act Provisions and Use of an Electronic Employment Eligibility Verification SystemEx. Ord. No. 12989, Feb. 13, 1996Feb. 28, 2003June 6, 2008This order is designed to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Government procurement. Stability and dependability are important elements of economy and efficiency. A contractor whose workforce is less stable will be less likely to produce goods and services economically and efficiently than a contractor whose workforce is more stable. It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce", " fully the immigration laws of the United States, including the detection and removal of illegal aliens and the imposition of legal sanctions against employers that hire illegal aliens. Because of the worksite enforcement policy of the United States and the underlying obligation of the executive branch to enforce the immigration laws, contractors that employ illegal aliens cannot rely on the continuing availability and service of those illegal workers, and such contractors inevitably will have a less stable and less dependable workforce than contractors that do not employ such persons. Where a contractor assigns illegal aliens to work on Federal contracts, the enforcement of Federal immigration laws imposes a direct risk of disruption, delay, and increased expense in Federal contracting. Such contractors are less dependable procurement sources, even if they do not knowingly hire or knowingly continue to employ unauthorized workers.Contractors that adopt rigorous employment eligibility confirmation policies are much less likely to face immigration enforcement actions, because they are less likely to employ unauthorized workers, and they are therefore generally more efficient and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not employ the best available measures to verify the work eligibility of their workforce. It is the policy of the executive branch to use an electronic employment verification system because, among other reasons, it provides the best available means to confirm the identity and work eligibility of all employees that join the Federal workforce. Private employers that choose to contract with the Federal Government should meet the same standard.I find, therefore, that adherence to the general policy of contracting only with providers that do not knowingly employ unauthorized alien workers and that have agreed to utilize an electronic employment verification system designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security to confirm the employment eligibility of their workforce will promote economy", " and efficiency in Federal procurement.NOW, THEREFORE, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including subsection 121(a) of title 40section 301 of title 3Section8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1)(A)(b) It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts, contracting agencies may not enter into contracts with employers that do not use the best available means to confirm the work authorization of their workforce.(c) It is the policy of the executive branch to enforce fully the antidiscrimination provisions of the INA. Nothing in this order relieves employers of antidiscrimination obligations under section 274B of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324b(d) All discretion under this order shall be exercised consistent with the policies set forth in this section.SecSec8 U.S.C. 1324a(e)(b) the Secretary of Homeland Security shall receive and may investigate complaints by employees of any entity covered under section 3(a) of this order where such complaints allege noncompliance with the INA employment provisions; and(c) the Attorney General shall hold such hearings as are required under 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e)Sec(b) The head of the contracting agency may debar the contractor or an organizational unit thereof based on the determination of the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General that it is not in compliance with the INA employment provisions. Such determination shall not be reviewable in the debarment proceedings.(c) The scope of the debarment generally should be limited to those organizational units of a Federal contractor that the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General finds are not in compliance with the INA employment provisions.(d) The period of the debarment shall be for 1 year and may be extended for additional perio", "ds of 1 year if, using the procedures established pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1324a(e)(e) The Administrator of General Services shall list a debarred contractor or an organizational unit thereof on the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs and the contractor or an organizational unit thereof shall be ineligible to participate in any procurement or nonprocurement activities.Sec(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security:(i) shall administer, maintain, and modify as necessary and appropriate the electronic employment eligibility verification system designated by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section; and(ii) may establish with respect to such electronic employment verification system:(A) terms and conditions for use of the system; and(B) procedures for monitoring the use, failure to use, or improper use of the system.(c) The Secretary of Defense, the Administrator of General Services, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to the extent necessary and appropriate to implement the debarment responsibility, the employment eligibility verification responsibility, and other related responsibilities assigned to heads of departments and agencies under this order.(d) Except to the extent otherwise specified by law or this order, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General:(i) shall administer and enforce this order; and(ii) may, after consultation to the extent appropriate with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of General Services, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, and the heads of such other departments or agencies as may be appropriate, issue such rules, regulations, or orders, or establish such requirements, as may be necessary and appropriate to implement this order.SecSecSec(b) This order shall be implemented in a manner consistent with the protection of intell", "igence and law enforcement sources, methods, and activities from unauthorized disclosure.Sec(i) authority granted by law to a department or agency or the head thereof; or(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budget, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDelegation of Authority To Report to the Congress and To Publish in the Federal Register Proposed Changes in the Social Security Number CardMemorandum of President of the United States, Feb. 10, 1992Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human ServicesSection 205(c)(2)(F) of the Social Security Act (section 405(c)(2)(F) of title 42By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 274A(d)(3)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) (section 1324a(d)(3)(A) of title 8section 301 of title 38 U.S.C. 1101(1) Authorize you to prepare and transmit, to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, a written report regarding the substance of any proposed change in Social Security number cards, to the extent required by section 274A(d)(3)(A) of the Act, and(2) Authorize you to cause to have printed in the Federal Register the substance of any change in the Social Security number card so proposed and reported to the designated congressional committees, to the extent required by section 274A(d)(3)(A) of the Act.The authority delegated by this memorandum may be further redelegated within the Department of Health and Human S", "ervices.You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nGeorge Bush. \u201cSEC. 401.

Statements of national policy concerning welfare and immigrationThe Congress makes th", "e following statements concerning national policy with respect to welfare and immigration:(1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country\u2019s earliest immigration statutes.(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that\u2014(A) aliens within the Nation\u2019s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations, and(B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.(3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates.(4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the public benefits system.(5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.(6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.(7) With respect to the State authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public benefits in this chapter, a State that chooses to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.(Pub.

Analyzing their characteristic travel documents and travel patterns could have allowed authorities to intercept some of the hijackers and a more effective use of information available in government databases could have identified some of the hijackers.\u201c(6) The routine operations of our immigration laws and the aspects of those laws not specifically aimed at protecting against terrorism inevitably shaped al Qaeda\u2019s planning and opportunities.\u201c(7) New insights into terrorist travel gained since September 11, 2001\u201c(8) The small classified terrorist travel intelligence collection and analysis program currently in place has produced useful results and should be expanded.\u201d \u00a7\u202f1777.

A choice has been made where established uses conflict.In clause (2), the definition of \u201cTerritory\u201d in 32:4c is executed throughout this revised title by specific reference, where applicable, to the Territories, Puerto Rico and the Canal Zone.In clause (4), the definition of \u201carmed forces\u201d is based on the source statute instead of 50:551(2), which does not include an express reference to the Marine Corps. The words \u201cincluding all components thereof\u201d are omitted as surplusage.In clause (5), the term \u201cDep", "artment\u201d is defined to give it the broad sense of \u201cEstablishment\u201d, to conform to the source statute and the usage preferred by the Department of Defense, instead of the more limited sense defined by 5:421g(a) and 423a(a), and 10:1a(d) and 1801(d).In clause (6), the term \u201cexecutive part of the department\u201d is created for convenience in referring to what is described in the source statutes for this title as \u201cdepartment\u201d in the limited sense of the executive part at the seat of government. This is required by the adoption of the word \u201cdepartment\u201d in clause (5) to cover the broader concept of \u201cestablishment\u201d.In clause (8), the term \u201cSecretary concerned\u201d is created and defined for legislative convenience.In clause (9), a definition of \u201cNational Guard\u201d is inserted for clarity.In clause (10)(A), the words \u201ca land force\u201d are substituted for 32:2 (as applicable to Army National Guard).

The reference to appointment in 10:1a(b) (2d sentence and 10:1801(b) (2d sentence), and the words \u201ccommissioned warrant officer\u201d, \u201cflight officer\u201d, and \u201ceither permanent or temporary\u201d, in 37:231(c) (1st sentence), are omitted as surplusage. 5:181\u20133(b) (1st sentence), 10:1a(b) (1st sentence), and 10:1801(b) (1st sentence) are omitted as covered by the definitions in clauses (14) and (16) of the revised section and by section 3062(c) and section 8062(d) of this titleIn clause (16), the words \u201cunless otherwise qualified\u201d, \u201cpermanent or temporary\u201d, and \u201cin the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard, including any component thereof\u201d are omitted as surplusage. The word \u201cperson\u201d is substituted for the word \u201cofficer\u201d. In clause (22), the definition of \u201cactive duty\u201d is based on the definition of \u201cactive Federal service\u201d in the source statute, since it is believed to be closer to general usage than the definition in 50:901(b), which excludes active duty for training from the general concept of active duty.\n\n\n\n\n\n1958 Act\nRevised sectionSource (U.S. Code)Source (Statutes at Large)\n101(25)50:1181(6).Sept. 3, 1954, ch. 1257, \u00a7\u202f102(6)68 Stat. 1150The words \u201c,\u2000other than a commissioned warrant officer,\u201d are inserted to reflect 50:1181(1).[Clause (35).] The word \u201coriginal\u201d is defined to make clear that when used in relation to an appointment it refers to the member\u2019s first appointment in his current series of appointments and excludes any appointment made before a lapse in service.Editorial Notes\nReferences in TextSection 125(d) of this titlePub.

L. 100\u2013202, \u00a7\u202f101(b) [title VIII, \u00a7\u202f8042]101 Stat. 1329\u201369Section 8042 of the FY88 Defense Appropriations", " Act (Public Law 100\u2013202section 113(k) of title 10The committee notes that the source section does not specify the period of time to be covered by the report. In the absence of statutory language specifying the period to be covered by the report, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the report should cover the previous fiscal year. The committee notes, however, that the report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on its FY88 defense appropriations bill (S. Rpt. 100\u2013235) states that this new annual report \u201cshould cover the budget years and the 2 previous fiscal years\u201d (page 54). The committee believes that such a requirement may be unnecessarily burdensome and in any case, if such a requirement is intended, should be stated in the statute. In the absence of clear intent, the provision is proposed to be codified without specifying the period of time to be covered by the annual report.In codifying this provision, the committee also changed the term \u201cUnited States troops\u201d in the source law to \u201cUnited States forces\u201d for consistency in usage in title 10 and as being preferable usage. No change in meaning is intended. The committee also changed \u201coverseas\u201d to \u201coutside the United States\u201d and defined \u201cUnited States\u201d for this purpose to include the territories and possessions of the United States. The committee was concerned that the term \u201coverseas\u201d read literally could include Hawaii or Guam, an interpretation clearly not intended in enacting section 8042. The committee notes that the Senate report referred to above states \u201cFor the purposes of this report [meaning the new DOD annual report], U.S. forces stationed overseas are considered to be those outside of the United States and its territories.\u201d. The committee extrapolates from this statement that provisions in the report requirement relating to expenditures \u201coverseas\u201d and costs incurred \u201coverseas\u201d are also to be construed as relating to matters outside the United States and its territories and has prepared the codified provision accordingly.Editorial Notes\nRefer", "ences in TextThe General Schedule, referred to in subsec.

No. 8829, May 25, 2012As we observe the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War, we reflect with solemn reverence upon the valor of a generation that served with honor. We pay tribute to the more than 3 million servicemen and women who left their families to serve bravely, a world away from everything they knew and everyone they loved. From Ia Drang to Khe Sanh, from Hue to Saigon and countless villages in between, they pushed through jungles and rice paddies, heat and monsoon, fighting heroically to protect the ideals we hold dear as Americans. Through more than a decade of combat, over air, land, and sea, these proud Americans upheld the highest traditions of our Armed Forces.As a grateful Nation, we honor more than 58,000 patriots\u2014their names etched in black granite\u2014who sacrificed all they had and all they would ever know. We draw inspiration from the heroes who suffered unspeakably as prisoners of war, yet who returned home with their heads held high. We pledge to keep faith with those who were wounded and still carry the scars of war, seen and unseen. With more than 1,600 of our service members still among the missing, we pledge as a Nation to do everything in our power to bring these patriots home. In the reflection of The Wall, we see the military family members and veterans who carry a pain that may never fade. May they find peace in knowing their loved ones endure, not only in medals and memories, but in the hearts of all Americans, who are forever grateful for their service, valor, and sacrifice.In recognition of a chapter in our Nation\u2019s history that must never be forgotten, let us renew our sacred commitment to those who answered our country\u2019s call in Vietnam and those who awaited their safe return. Beginning on Memorial Day 2012, the Federal Government will partner with local governments, private organizations, and commu", "nities across America to participate in the Commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Vietnam War\u2014a 13-year program to honor and give thanks to a generation of proud Americans who saw our country through one of the most challenging missions we have ever faced. While no words will ever be fully worthy of their service, nor any honor truly befitting their sacrifice, let us remember that it is never too late to pay tribute to the men and women who answered the call of duty with courage and valor. Let us renew our commitment to the fullest possible accounting for those who have not returned. Throughout this Commemoration, let us strive to live up to their example by showing our Vietnam veterans, their families, and all who have served the fullest respect and support of a grateful Nation.NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 28, 2012November 11, 2025IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twelve, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-sixth.\nBarack Obama.\nEx.
