Recommendations and guidelines regarding automated external defibrillators for Federal buildings(a) Guidelines on placementThe Secretary shall establish guidelines with respect to placing automated external defibrillator devices in Federal buildings. Such guidelines shall take into account the extent to which such devices may be used by lay persons, the typical number of employees and visitors in the buildings, the extent of the need for security measures regarding the buildings, buildings or portions of buildings in which there are special circumstances such as high electrical voltage or extreme heat or cold, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.(b) Related recommendationsThe Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the recommendations of the Secretary on the appropriate implementation of the placement of automated external defibrillator devices under subsection (a), including procedures for the following:(1) Implementing appropriate training courses in the use of such devices, including the role of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.(2) Proper maintenance and testing of the devices.(3) Ensuring coordination with appropriate licensed professionals in the oversight of training of the devices.(4) Ensuring coordination with local emergency medical systems regarding the placement and incidents of use of the devices.(c) Consultations; consideration of certain recommendationsIn carrying out this section, the Secretary shall\u2014(1) consult with appropriate public and private entities;(2) consider the recommendations of national and local public-health organizations for improving the survival rates of individuals who experience cardiac arrest in nonhospital settings by minimizing the time elapsing betw", "een the onset of cardiac arrest and the initial medical response, including defibrillation as necessary; and(3) consult with and counsel other Federal agencies where such devices are to be used.(d) Date certain for establishing guidelines and recommendationsThe Secretary shall comply with this section not later than 180 days after November 13, 2000(e) DefinitionsFor purposes of this section:(1) The term \u201cautomated external defibrillator device\u201d has the meaning given such term in section 238q of this title(2) The term \u201cFederal building\u201d includes a building or portion of a building leased or rented by a Federal agency, and includes buildings on military installations of the United States.(July 1, 1944, ch. 373Pub.

Ventricular fibrillation occurs when the heart\u2019s electrical system malfunctions, causing a chaotic rhythm that prevents the heart from pumping oxygen to the victim\u2019s brain and body.\u201c(7) Communities that have implemented programs ensuring widespread public access to defibrillators, combined with appropriate training, maintenanc", "e, and coordination with local emergency medical systems, have dramatically improved the survival rates from cardiac arrest.\u201c(8) Automated external defibrillator devices have been demonstrated to be safe and effective, even when used by lay people, since the devices are designed not to allow a user to administer a shock until after the device has analyzed a victim\u2019s heart rhythm and determined that an electric shock is required.\u201c(9) Increasing public awareness regarding automated external defibrillator devices and encouraging their use in Federal buildings will greatly facilitate their adoption.\u201c(10) Limiting the liability of Good Samaritans and acquirers of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations may encourage the use of automated external defibrillator devices, and result in saved lives.\u201dCertain Technologies and Practices Regarding Survival Rates for Cardiac ArrestPub.

Each year in the United States there are approximately 30,000 firearm-related deaths, and approximately 11,000 of those deaths result from homicides. Addressing this critical issue requires a comprehensive, multifaceted approach.Recent research suggests that, in developing such an approach, a broader public health perspective is imperative. Significant strides can be made by assessing the causes of gun violence and the successful efforts in place for preventing the misuse of firearms. Taking these steps will improve our understanding of the gun violence epidemic and will aid in the continued development of gun violence prevention strategies.Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:SectionResearchSecGeneral Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative ", "proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.SecPublication\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f242.

Every 2 minutes, an individual goes into cardiac arrest in the United States.\u201c(2) The chance of successfully returning to a normal heart rhythm diminishes by 10 percent each minute following sudden cardiac arrest.\u201c(3) Eighty percent of cardiac arrests are caused by ventricular fibrillation, for which defibrillation is the only effective treatment.\u201c(4) Sixty percent of all cardiac arrests occur outside the hospital. The average national survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is only 5 percent.\u201c(5) Communities that have established and implemented public access defibrillation programs have achieved average survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as high as 50 percent.\u201c(6) According to the American Heart Association, wide use of defibrillators could save as many as 50,000 lives nationally each year.\u201c(7) Successful public access defibrillation programs ensure that cardiac arrest victims have access to early 911 notification, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early defibrillation, and early advanced care.\u201d \u00a7\u202f244\u20131.

However, some conditions pose excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared to all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.\u201c(4) Birth defects can be caused by expos", "ure to environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are slowed by lack of information about the number and causes of birth defects. Outbreaks of birth defects may go undetected because surveillance and research efforts are underdeveloped and poorly coordinated.\u201c(5) Public awareness strategies, such as programs using folic acid vitamin supplements to prevent spina bifida and alcohol avoidance programs to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, are essential to prevent the heartache and costs associated with birth defects.\u201d\nDefinitionsFor meaning of references to an intellectual disability and to individuals with intellectual disabilities in provisions amended by section 2 of Pub.

Unlike any of the other muscular dystrophies, the muscle weakness is accompanied by myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction) and by a variety of abnormalities in addition to those of muscle.\u201c(8) Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (referred to in this section as \u2018FSHD\u2019) is a neuromuscular disorder that is inherited genetically and has an estimated frequency of 1 in 20,000. FSHD, affecting between 15,000 to 40,000 persons, causes a progressive and sever [sic] loss of skeletal muscle gradually bringing weakness and reduced mobility. Many persons with FSHD become severely physically disabled and spend many decades in a wheelchair.\u201c(9) FSHD is regarded as a novel genetic phenomenon resulting from a crossover of subtelomeric DNA and may be the only human disease caused by a deletion-mutation.\u201c(10) Each of the muscular dystrophies, though distinct in progressivity and severity of symptoms, have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of children and adults throughout the United States and worldwide and impose severe physical and economic burd", "ens on those affected.\u201c(11) Muscular dystrophies have a significant impact on quality of life\u2014not only for the individual who experiences its painful symptoms and resulting disability, but also for family members and caregivers.\u201c(12) Development of therapies for these disorders, while realistic with recent advances in research, is likely to require costly investments and infrastructure to support gene and other therapies.\u201c(13) There is a shortage of qualified researchers in the field of neuromuscular research.\u201c(14) Many family physicians and health care professionals lack the knowledge and resources to detect and properly diagnose the disease as early as possible, thus exacerbating the progressiveness of symptoms in cases that go undetected or misdiagnosed.\u201c(15) There is a need for efficient mechanisms to translate clinically relevant findings in muscular dystrophy research from basic science to applied work.\u201c(16) Educating the public and health care community throughout the country about this devastating disease is of paramount importance and is in every respect in the public interest and to the benefit of all communities.\u201dReport to CongressPub.

They were beloved parents, grandparents, children, siblings, spouses, neighbors, and friends. More than 200,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver to the disease. Each soul is irreplaceable, and the families and communities left behind are still reeling from profound loss. Many families and communities have already received support from Federal programs that help with the loss they have experienced. As we move forward, we commit to ensuring that families and communities can access these support programs and connect to resources they may need to help with their healing, health, and well-being.At the same time, many of our family members, neighbors, and friends continue to experience negative long-term effects of COVID\u201319.

Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States to Promote National Security and Public HealthEx. Ord. No. 13887, Sept. 19, 2019By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3SectionFindings(b) Vacc", "ination is the most effective defense against influenza. Despite recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that nearly every American should receive the influenza vaccine annually, however, seasonal influenza vaccination levels in the United States have currently reached only about 45 percent of CDC goals.(c) All influenza vaccines presently in use have been developed for circulating or anticipated influenza viruses. These vaccines must be reformulated for each influenza season as well as in the event of a pandemic. Additional research is needed to develop influenza vaccines that provide more effective and longer-lasting protection against many or all influenza viruses.(d) The current domestic enterprise for manufacturing influenza vaccines has critical shortcomings. Most influenza vaccines are made in chicken eggs, using a 70-year-old process that requires months-long production timelines, limiting their utility for pandemic control; rely on a potentially vulnerable supply chain of eggs; require the use of vaccine viruses adapted for growth in eggs, which could introduce mutations of the influenza vaccine virus that may render the final product less effective; and are unsuitable for efficient and scalable continuous manufacturing platforms.(e) The seasonal influenza vaccine market rewards manufacturers that deliver vaccines in time for the influenza season, without consideration of the speed or scale of these manufacturers\u2019 production processes. This approach is insufficient to meet the response needs in the event of a pandemic, which can emerge rapidly and with little warning. Because the market does not sufficiently reward speed, and because a pandemic has the potential to overwhelm or compromise essential government functions, including defense and homeland security, the Government must take action to promote faster and more scalable manufacturing platforms.SecPolicySecNational Influenza Vaccine Task Force(b) In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of a senior ", "official from the following executive branch departments, agencies, and offices:(i) the Department of Defense (DOD);(ii) the Department of Justice;(iii) the Department of Agriculture;(iv) the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA);(v) the Department of Homeland Security;(vi) the United States Food and Drug Administration;(vii) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;(viii) the National Institutes of Health (NIH);(ix) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); and(x) the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).(c) The Co-Chairs may jointly invite additional Federal Government representatives, with the consent of the applicable executive department, agency, or office head, to attend meetings of the Task Force or to become members of the Task Force, as appropriate.(d) The staffs of the Department of State, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the National Security Council, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Domestic Policy Council, the National Economic Council, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) may attend and participate in any Task Force meetings or discussions.(e) The Task Force may consult with State, local, tribal, and territorial government officials and private sector representatives, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law.(f) Within 120 days of the date of this order [Sept. 19, 2019(i) a 5-year national plan (Plan) to promote the use of more agile and scalable vaccine manufacturing technologies and to accelerate development of vaccines that protect against many or all influenza viruses;(ii) recommendations for encouraging non-profit, academic, and private-sector influenza vaccine innovation; and(iii) recommendations for increasing influenza vaccination among the populations recommended by the CDC and for improving public understanding of influenza risk and informed influenza vaccine decision-making.(g) Not later than June 1 of each of the 5 years following submission of the report described in subsection (f) of this section, the T", "ask Force shall submit an update on implementation of the Plan and, as appropriate, new recommendations for achieving the policy objectives set forth in section 2 of this order.SecAgency Implementation(a) The Secretary of HHS shall:(i) through the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and BARDA:(A) estimate the cost of expanding and diversifying domestic vaccine-manufacturing capacity to use innovative, faster, and more scalable technologies, including cell-based and recombinant vaccine manufacturing, through cost-sharing agreements with the private sector, which shall include an agreed-upon pricing strategy during a pandemic;(B) estimate the cost of expanding domestic production capacity of adjuvants in order to combine such adjuvants with both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines;(C) estimate the cost of expanding domestic fill-and-finish capacity to rapidly fulfill antigen and adjuvant needs for pandemic response;(D) estimate the cost of developing, evaluating, and implementing delivery systems to augment limited supplies of needles and syringes and to enable the rapid and large-scale administration of pandemic influenza vaccines;(E) evaluate incentives for the development and production of vaccines by private manufacturers and public-private partnerships, including, in emergency situations, the transfer of technology to public-private partnerships\u2014such as the HHS Centers for Innovation and Advanced Development and Manufacturing or other domestic manufacturing facilities\u2014in advance of a pandemic, in order to be able to ensure adequate domestic pandemic manufacturing capacity and capability;(F) support, in coordination with the DOD, NIH, and VA, a suite of clinical studies featuring different adjuvants to support development of improved vaccines and further expand vaccine supply by reducing the dose of antigen required; and(G) update, in coordination with other relevant public health agencies, the research agenda to dramatically improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability of influenza", " vaccine production;(ii) through the Director of NIH, provide to the Task Force estimated timelines for implementing NIH\u2019s strategic plan and research agenda for developing influenza vaccines that can protect individuals over many years against multiple types of influenza viruses;(iii) through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs:(A) further implement vaccine production process improvements to reduce the time required for vaccine production (e.g., through the use of novel technologies for vaccine seed virus development and through implementation of improved potency and sterility assays);(B) develop, in conjunction with the CDC, proposed alternatives for the timing of vaccine virus selection to account for potentially shorter timeframes associated with non-egg based manufacturing and to facilitate vaccines optimally matched to the circulating strains;(C) further support the conduct, in collaboration with the DOD, BARDA, and CDC, of applied scientific research regarding developing cell lines and expression systems that markedly increase the yield of cell-based and recombinant influenza vaccine manufacturing processes;

No. 13937, July 24, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPurposeThe price of insulin in the United States has risen dramatically over the past decade. The list price for a single vial of insulin today is often more than $250 and most patients use at least two vials per month. As for injectable epinephrine, recent increased competition is helping to drive prices down. Nevertheless, the price for some types of injectable epinephrine remains more than $600 per kit. While Americans with diabetes and severe allergic reactions may have access to affordable insulin and injectable epinephrine through commercial insurance or Federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, many Americans still st", "ruggle to purchase these products.Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), as defined in section 1905(l)(2)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1396d(l)(2)(B)(i)Sec.PolicySec.Improving the Availability of Insulin and Injectable Epinephrine for the Uninsured42 U.S.C. 254b(e)(a) have a high cost sharing requirement for either insulin or injectable epinephrine;(b) have a high unmet deductible; or(c) have no health care insurance.Sec.General Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof;(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDonald J. Trump.\nMedicare Demonstration To Test Medical Homes in Federally Qualified Health CentersMemorandum of President of the United States, Dec. 9, 2009Memorandum for the Secretary of Health And Human ServicesMy Administration is committed to building a high-quality, efficient health care system and improving access to health care for all Americans. Health centers are a vital part of the health care delivery system. For more than 40 years, health centers have served populations with limited access to health care, treating all patients regardless of ability to pay. These include low-income populations, the uninsured, individuals with limited English proficiency, migrant and seasonal farm workers, individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and individuals living in public housing. There are over 1,100 health centers across the country, delivering care at over 7,500 sites. These centers served more than 17 million patie", "nts in 2008 and are estimated to serve more than 20 million patients in 2010.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) provided $2 billion for health centers, including $500 million to expand health centers\u2019 services to over 2 million new patients by opening new health center sites, adding new providers, and improving hours of operations. An additional $1.5 billion is supporting much-needed capital improvements, including funding to buy equipment, modernize clinic facilities, expand into new facilities, and adopt or expand the use of health information technology and electronic health records.One of the key benefits health centers provide to the communities they serve is quality primary health care services. Health centers use interdisciplinary teams to treat the \u201cwhole patient\u201d and focus on chronic disease management to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as emergency rooms and hospitals.Federally qualified health centers provide an excellent environment to demonstrate the further improvements to health care that may be offered by the medical homes approach. In general, this approach emphasizes the patient\u2019s relationship with a primary care provider who coordinates the patient\u2019s care and serves as the patient\u2019s principal point of contact for care. The medical homes approach also emphasizes activities related to quality improvement, access to care, communication with patients, and care management and coordination. These activities are expected to improve the quality and efficiency of care and to help avoid preventable emergency and inpatient hospital care. Demonstration programs establishing the medical homes approach have been recommended by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent advisory body to the Congress.Therefore, I direct you to implement a Medicare Federally Qualified Health Center Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration, pursuant to your statutory authority to conduct experiments and demonstrations on changes in payments and services that may", " improve the quality and efficiency of services to beneficiaries. Health centers participating in this demonstration must have shown their ability to provide comprehensive, coordinated, integrated, and accessible health care.This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\nBarack Obama. \u00a7\u202f254b\u20131.

No. 13941, Aug. 3, 2020By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:SectionPurposeSince 2010, the year the [Patient Protection and] Affordable Care Act [Pub. L. 111\u201314", "8During the COVID\u201319 public health emergency (PHE), hospitals curtailed elective medical procedures and access to in-person clinical care was limited. To help patients better access healthcare providers, my Administration implemented new flexibility regarding what services may be provided via telehealth, who may provide them, and in what circumstances, and the use of telehealth increased dramatically across the Nation. Internal analysis by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) showed a weekly jump in virtual visits for CMS beneficiaries, from approximately 14,000 pre-PHE to almost 1.7 million in the last week of April. Additionally, a recent report by HHS shows that nearly half (43.5 percent) of Medicare fee-for-service primary care visits were provided through telehealth in April, compared with far less than one percent (0.1 percent) in February before the PHE. Importantly, the report finds that telehealth visits continued to be frequent even after in-person primary care visits resumed in May, indicating that the expansion of telehealth services is likely to be a more permanent feature of the healthcare delivery system.Rural healthcare providers, in particular, need these types of flexibilities to provide continuous care to patients in their communities. It is the purpose of this order to increase access to, improve the quality of, and improve the financial economics of rural healthcare, including by increasing access to high-quality care through telehealth.Sec.Launching an Innovative Payment Model to Enable Rural Healthcare TransformationAug. 3, 202042 U.S.C. 1315aSec.Investments in Physical and Communications InfrastructureSec.Improving the Health of Rural Americans(a) increase rural access to healthcare by eliminating regulatory burdens that limit the availability of clinical professionals;(b) prevent disease and mortality by developing rural-specific efforts to drive improved health outcomes;(c) reduce maternal mortality and morbidity; and(d", ") improve mental health in rural communities.Sec.Expanding Flexibilities Beyond the Public Health Emergency(a) the additional telehealth services offered to Medicare beneficiaries; and(b) the services, reporting, staffing, and supervision flexibilities offered to Medicare providers in rural areas.Sec.General Provisions(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nDonald J.

L. 108\u2013377, \u00a7\u202f2Oct. 30, 2004118 Stat. 2202\n\u201cThe Congress finds the following:\u201c(1) Asthma is a chronic condition requiring lifetime, ongoing medical intervention.\u201c(2) In 1980, 6,700,000 Americans had asthma.\u201c(3) In 2001, 20,300,000 Americans had asthma; 6,300,000 children under age 18 had asthma.\u201c(4) The prevalence of asthma among African-American children was 40 percent greater than among Caucasian children, and more than 26 percent of all asthma deaths are in the African-American population.\u201c(5) In 2000, there were 1,800,000 asthma-related visits to emergency departments (more than 728,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).\u201c(6) In 2000, there were 465,000 asthma-related hospitalizations (214,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).\u201c(7) In 2000, 4,487 pe", "ople died from asthma, and of these 223 were children.\u201c(8) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma is a common cause of missed school days, accounting for approximately 14,000,000 missed school days annually.\u201c(9) According to the New England Journal of Medicine, working parents of children with asthma lose an estimated $1,000,000,000 a year in productivity.\u201c(10) At least 30 States have legislation protecting the rights of children to carry and self-administer asthma metered-dose inhalers, and at least 18 States expand this protection to epinephrine auto-injectors.\u201c(11) Tragic refusals of schools to permit students to carry their inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine have occurred, some resulting in death and spawning litigation.\u201c(12) School district medication policies must be developed with the safety of all students in mind. The immediate and correct use of asthma inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine are necessary to avoid serious respiratory complications and improve health care outcomes.\u201c(13) No school should interfere with the patient-physician relationship.\u201c(14) Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a systemic allergic reaction that can kill within minutes. Anaphylaxis occurs in some asthma patients. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, people who have experienced symptoms of anaphylaxis previously are at risk for subsequent reactions and should carry an epinephrine auto-injector with them at all times, if prescribed.\u201c(15) An increasing number of students and school staff have life-threatening allergies. Exposure to the affecting allergen can trigger anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires prompt medical intervention with an injection of epinephrine.\u201d \u00a7\u202f280g\u20131.

L. 109\u2013162, title V, \u00a7\u202f501Jan. 5, 2006119 Stat. 3023\n\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The health-related costs of intimate partner violence in the United States exceed $5,800,000,000 annually.\u201c(2) Thirty-seven percent of all women who sought care in hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend.\u201c(3) In addition to injuries sustained during violent episodes, physical and psychological abuse is linked to a number of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women who have been abused are much more likely to suffer from chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended pregnancies, substance abuse and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.\u201c(4) Health plans spend an average of $1,775 more a year on abused women than on general enrollees.\u201c(5) Each year about 324,000 pregnant women in the United States are battered by the men in their lives. This battering leads to complications of pregnancy, including low weight gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester bleeding.\u201c(6) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to be victims of homicide than to die of any other pregnancy-related cause, and evidence exists that a significant proportion of all female homicide victims are killed by their intimate partners.\u201c(7) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual assault crimes.\u201c(8) Recent research suggests that women experiencing domestic violence significantly increase their safety-promoting behaviors over the short- and long-term when health care providers screen for, identify, and provide followup care and informa", "tion to address the violence.\u201c(9) Currently, only about 10 percent of primary care physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during new patient visits and 9 percent routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during periodic checkups.\u201c(10) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a 10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of screening men.\u201c(11) Seventy to 81 percent of the patients studied reported that they would like their healthcare providers to ask them privately about intimate partner violence.\u201dPurposePub.
