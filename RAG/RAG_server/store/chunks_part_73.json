Intimate partner violence and child abuse overlap in the same families at rates between 30 and 60 percent. A child\u2019s risk of abuse increases after a perpetrator of intimate partner violence separates from a domestic partner, even when the perpetrator has not previously directly abused the child. Children who have witnessed intimate partner violence are approximately 4 times more likely to experience direct child maltreatment than children who have not witnessed intimate partner violence.\u201c(3) More than 75 percent of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by a family member or a person known to the child. Data of the Department of Justice shows that family members are 49 percent, or almost half, of the perpetrators of crimes against child sex assault victims younger than 6 years of age.\u201c(4) Research suggests a child\u2019s exposure to a batterer is among the strongest indicators of risk of incest victimization. One study found that female children with fathers who are batterers of their mothers were 6.5 times more likely to experience father-daughter incest than female children who do not have abusive fathers.\u201c(5) Child abuse is a major public health issue in the United States. Total lifetime financial costs associated with just 1 year of confirmed cases of child maltreatment, including child physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect, result in $124,000,000,000 in annual costs to the economy of the ", "United States, or approximately 1 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States.\u201c(6) Empirical research indicates that courts regularly discount allegations of child physical and sexual abuse when those allegations are raised in child custody cases. Courts believed less than \u00bc of claims that a father has committed child physical or sexual abuse. With respect to cases in which an allegedly abusive parent claimed the mother \u2018alienated\u2019 the child, courts believed only 1 out of 51 claims of sexual molestation by a father. Independent research indicates that child sexual abuse allegations are credible between 50 and 70 percent of the time.\u201c(7) Empirical research shows that alleged or known abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected parenting time by courts. Approximately \u2153 of parents alleged to have committed child abuse took primary custody from the protective parent reporting the abuse, placing children at ongoing risk.\u201c(8) Researchers have documented nearly 800 child murders in the United States since 2008 committed by a divorcing or separating parent. More than 100 of these child murders are known to have occurred after a court ordered the child to have contact with the dangerous parent over the objection of a safe parent or caregiver.\u201c(9) Scientifically unsound theories that treat abuse allegations of mothers as likely false attempts to undermine fathers are frequently applied in family court to minimize or deny reports of abuse of parents and children. Many experts who testify against abuse allegations lack expertise in the relevant type of alleged abuse, relying instead on unsound and unproven theories.\u201c(10) Judges presiding over custody cases involving allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and domestic violence are rarely required to receive training on these subjects, and most States have not established standards for such training.\u201d[For definitions of terms used in section 1502 of div.

Findings(a) The Congress finds the following:(1) Although the juvenile violent crime arrest rate in 1999 was the lowest in the decade, there remains a consensus that the number of crimes and the rate of offending by juveniles nationwide is still too high.(2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, allowing 1 youth to leave school for a life of crime and of drug abuse costs society $1,700,000 to $2,300,000 annually.(3) One in every 6 individuals (16.2 percent) arrested for committing violent crime in 1999 was less than 18 years of age. In 1999, juveniles accounted for 9 percent of murder arrests, 17 percent of forcible rape arrests, 25 percent of robbery arrest, 14 percent of aggravated assault arrests, and 24 percent of weapons arrests.(4) More than \u00bd of juvenile murder victims are killed with firearms. Of the nearly 1,800 murder victims less than 18 years of age, 17 percent of the victims less than 13 years of age were murdered with a firearm, and 81 percent of the victims 13 years of age or older were killed with a firearm.(5) Juveniles accounted for 13 percent of all drug abuse violation arrests in 1999. Between 1990 and 1999, juvenile arrests for drug abuse violations rose 132 percent.(6) Over the last 3 decades, youth gang problems have increased nationwide. In the 1970\u2019s, 19 States reported youth gang problems. By the late 1990\u2019s, all 50 States and the District of Columbia reported gang problems. For the same period, the number of cities reporting youth gang problems grew 843 percent, and the number of counties reporting gang problems increased more than 1,000 percent.(7) According to a national crime survey of individuals 12 years of age or old", "er during 1999, those 12 to 19 years old are victims of violent crime at higher rates than individuals in all other age groups. Only 30.8 percent of these violent victimizations were reported by youth to police in 1999.(8) One-fifth of juveniles 16 years of age who had been arrested were first arrested before attaining 12 years of age. Juveniles who are known to the juvenile justice system before attaining 13 years of age are responsible for a disproportionate share of serious crimes and violence.(9) The increase in the arrest rates for girls and young juvenile offenders has changed the composition of violent offenders entering the juvenile justice system.(10) These problems should be addressed through a 2-track common sense approach that addresses the needs of individual juveniles and society at large by promoting\u2014(A) quality prevention programs that\u2014(i) work with juveniles, their families, local public agencies, and community-based organizations, and take into consideration such factors as whether or not juveniles have been the victims of family violence (including child abuse and neglect); and(ii) are designed to reduce risks and develop competencies in at-risk juveniles that will prevent, and reduce the rate of, violent delinquent behavior; and(B) programs that assist in holding juveniles accountable for their actions and in developing the competencies necessary to become responsible and productive members of their communities, including a system of graduated sanctions to respond to each delinquent act, requiring juveniles to make restitution, or perform community service, for the damage caused by their delinquent acts, and methods for increasing victim satisfaction with respect to the penalties imposed on juveniles for their acts.(11) Coordinated juvenile justice and delinquency prevention projects that meet the needs of juveniles through the collaboration of the many local service systems juveniles encounter can help prevent juveniles from becoming delinquent and help delinquent youth return to a productive", " life.(b) Congress must act now to reform this program by focusing on juvenile delinquency prevention programs, as well as programs that hold juveniles accountable for their acts and which provide opportunities for competency development. Without true reform, the juvenile justice system will not be able to overcome the challenges it will face in the coming years when the number of juveniles is expected to increase by 18 percent between 2000 and 2030.(Pub.

FindingsThe Congress finds that\u2014(1) youth who have become homeless or who leave and remain away from home without parental permission, are at risk of developing, and have a disproportionate share of, serious health, behavioral, and emotional problems because they lack sufficient resources to obtain care and may live on the street for extended periods thereby endangering themselves and creating a substantial law enforcement problem for communities in which they congregate;(2) many such young people, because of their age and situation, are urgently in need of temporary shelter and services, including services that are linguistically appropriate and acknowledge the environment of youth seeking these services;(3) services to such young people should be developed and provided using a positive youth development approach that ensures a young person a sense of\u2014(A) safety and structure;(B) belonging and membership;(C) self-worth and social contribution;(D) independence and control over one\u2019s life; and(E) closeness in interpersonal relationships.11(4) in view of the interstate nature of the problem, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to develop an accurate national reporting system to report the problem, and to assist in the development of an effective system of care (including preventive and aftercare services, emergency shelter services, extended residential shelter, and street outreach services) outside the welfare system and the law enforcement system;(5) to make a successful transition to adulthood, runaway youth, homeless youth, and other street youth need opportunities to complete high school or earn a general equivalency degree, learn job skills, and obtain employment; and(6) improved coordination and collaboration between the Federal programs that serve runaway and homeless youth are necessary for the development of a long-term strategy for responding t", "o the needs of this population.(Pub.

SHORT TITLE.\u201cThis Act may be cited as the \u2018National Police Athletic/Activities League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000\u2019.\u201cSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\u201cCongress makes the following findings:\u201c(1) The goals of the Police Athletic/Activities League are to\u2014\u201c(A) increase the academic success of youth participants in PAL programs;\u201c(B) promote a safe, healthy environment for youth under the supervision of law enforcement personnel where mutual trust and respect can be", " built;\u201c(C) develop life enhancing character and leadership skills in young people;\u201c(D) increase school attendance by providing alternatives to suspensions and expulsions;\u201c(E) reduce the juvenile crime rate in participating designated communities and the number of police calls involving juveniles during nonschool hours;\u201c(F) provide youths with alternatives to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang activity;\u201c(G) create positive communications and interaction between youth and law enforcement personnel; and\u201c(H) prepare youth for the workplace.\u201c(2) The Police Athletic/Activities League, during its 90-year history as a national organization, has proven to be a positive force in the communities it serves.\u201c(3) The Police Athletic/Activities League is a network of 1,700 facilities serving over 3,000 communities. There are 350 PAL chapters throughout the United States, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, serving 2,000,000 youth, ages 5 to 18, nationwide.\u201c(4) Based on PAL chapter demographics, approximately 85 percent of the youths who benefit from PAL programs live in inner cities and urban areas.\u201c(5) PAL chapters are locally operated, volunteer-driven organizations. Although most PAL chapters are sponsored by a law enforcement agency, PAL chapters rarely receive direct funding from law enforcement agencies and are dependent in large part on support from the private sector, such as individuals, business leaders, corporations, and foundations.

The lack of anonymity and accessible support services can limit opportunities for justice for victims.\u201c(6) Domestic elder abuse is primarily family abuse. The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study found that the perpetrator was a family member in 90 percent of cases.\u201c(7) Barriers for older victims leaving abusive relationships include\u2014\u201c(A) the inability to support themselves;\u201c(B) poor health that increases their dependence on the abuser;\u201c(C) fear of being placed in a nursing home; and\u201c(D) ineffective responses by domestic abuse programs and law enforcement.\u201c(8) Disabled women comprise another vulnerable population with unmet needs. Women with disabilities are more likely to be th", "e victims of abuse and violence than women without disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, social, or psychological dependence on others.\u201c(9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear being abandoned or institutionalized.\u201c(10) Of the 598 battered women\u2019s programs surveyed\u2014\u201c(A) only 35 percent of these programs offered disability awareness training for their staff; and\u201c(B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to provide services to women with disabilities.\u201c(11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of their family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to file immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and children as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant women from seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in violent homes because of fear of deportation.\u201c(12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to the police or a 9\u20131\u20131 operator, or even in acquiring information about their rights and the legal system.\u201c(13) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.\u201c(14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.\u201c(15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence Hotline provides crisis intervention and immediately connects callers with sources of help in their local community.\u201c(16) Approximately ", "60 percent of the callers indicate that calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a domestic violence situation and that they have not called the police or any other support services.\u201c(17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase in call volume at the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\u201c(18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically increase the Hotline\u2019s ability to answer more calls quickly and effectively.\u201dPub. L. 109\u2013162, title III, \u00a7\u202f301Jan. 5, 2006119 Stat. 3003\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1) Youth, under the age of 18, account for 67 percent of all sexual assault victimizations reported to law enforcement officials.\u201c(2) The Department of Justice consistently finds that young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence.\u201c(3) In 1 year, over 4,000 incidents of rape or sexual assault occurred in public schools across the country.\u201c(4) Young people experience particular obstacles to seeking help. They often do not have access to money, transportation, or shelter services. They must overcome issues such as distrust of adults, lack of knowledge about available resources, or pressure from peers and parents.\u201c(5) A needs assessment on teen relationship abuse for the State of California, funded by the California Department of Health Services, identified a desire for confidentiality and confusion about the law as 2 of the most significant barriers to young victims of domestic and dating violence seeking help.\u201c(6) Only one State specifically allows for minors to petition the court for protection orders.\u201c(7) Many youth are involved in dating relationships, and these relationships can include the same kind of domestic violence and dating violence seen in the adult population. In fact, more than 40 percent of all incidents of domestic violence involve people who are not married.\u201c(8) 40 percent of girls ages 14 ", "to 17 report knowing someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend, and 13 percent of college women report being stalked.\u201c(9) Of college women who said they had been the victims of rape or attempted rape, 12.8 percent of completed rapes, 35 percent of attempted rapes, and 22.9 percent of threatened rapes took place on a date. Almost 60 percent of the completed rapes that occurred on campus took place in the victim\u2019s residence.\u201c(10) According to a 3-year study of student-athletes at 10 Division I universities, male athletes made up only 3.3 percent of the general male university population, but they accounted for 19 percent of the students reported for sexual assault and 35 percent of domestic violence perpetrators.\u201dDefinitions and Grant ConditionsPub.

Online abuse and harassment, which aim to preclude women from political decision-making about their own lives and communities, undermine the functioning of democracy. Growing evidence also demonstrates that online radicalization can be linked to gender-based violence, which, along with other forms of abuse and harassment, spans the digital and physical re", "alms. Online harassment and abuse can result in a range of dire consequences for victims, from psychological distress and self-censorship to economic losses, disruptions to education, increased self-harm, suicide, homicide, and other forms of physical and sexual violence. Further, digital technologies are often used in concert with other forms of abuse and harassment, underscoring the urgency of addressing the interplay of in-person and online harms. More research is needed to fully understand the nature, magnitude, and costs of these harms and ways to address them in the United States and globally.Therefore, I am directing the Director of the White House Gender Policy Council and the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to lead an interagency effort to address online harassment and abuse, specifically focused on technology-facilitated gender-based violence, and to develop concrete recommendations to improve prevention, response, and protection efforts through programs and policies in the United States and globally.Sec.EstablishmentSec.Membership(b) In addition to the Co-Chairs, the Task Force shall consist of the following members:(i) the Secretary of State;(ii) the Secretary of Defense;(iii) the Attorney General;(iv) the Secretary of Commerce;(v) the Secretary of Health and Human Services;(vi) the Secretary of Education;(vii) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;(viii) the Secretary of Homeland Security;(ix) the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy;(x) the Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council;(xi) the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council;(xii) the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development;(xiii) the Counsel to the President;(xiv) the Counsel to the Vice President;

FindingsCongress finds that:(1) There is a strong link between domestic violence and homelessness. Among cities surveyed, 44 percent identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.(2) Ninety-two percent of homeless women have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Of all homeless women and children, 60 percent had been abused by age 12, and 63 percent have been victims of intimate partner violence as adults.(3) Women and families across the country are being discriminated against, denied access to, and even evicted from public and subsidized housing because of their status as victims of domestic violence.(4) A recent survey of legal service providers around the country found that these providers have responded to almost 150 documented eviction cases in the last year alone where the tenant was evicted because of the domestic violence crimes committed against her. In addition, nearly 100 clients were denied housing because of their status as victims of domestic violence.(5) Women who leave their abusers frequently lack adequate emergency shelter options. The lack of adequate emergency options for victims presents a serious threat to their safety and the safety of their children. Requests for emergency shelter by homeless women with children increased by 78 percent of United States cities surveyed in 2004. In the same year, 32 percent of the requests for shelter by homeless families went unmet due to the lack ", "of available emergency shelter beds.(6) The average stay at an emergency shelter is 60 days, while the average length of time it takes a homeless family to secure housing is 6 to 10 months.(7) Victims of domestic violence often return to abusive partners because they cannot find long-term housing.(8) There are not enough Federal housing rent vouchers available to accommodate the number of people in need of long-term housing. Some people remain on the waiting list for Federal housing rent vouchers for years, while some lists are closed.(9) Transitional housing resources and services provide an essential continuum between emergency shelter provision and independent living. A majority of women in transitional housing programs stated that had these programs not existed, they would have likely gone back to abusive partners.(10) Because abusers frequently manipulate finances in an effort to control their partners, victims often lack steady income, credit history, landlord references, and a current address, all of which are necessary to obtain long-term permanent housing.(11) Victims of domestic violence in rural areas face additional barriers, challenges, and unique circumstances, such as geographical isolation, poverty, lack of public transportation systems, shortages of health care providers, under-insurance or lack of health insurance, difficulty ensuring confidentiality in small communities, and decreased access to many resources (such as advanced education, job opportunities, and adequate childcare).(12) Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development have recognized in recent years that families experiencing domestic violence have unique needs that should be addressed by those administering the Federal housing programs.(Pub.

W, title VII, \u00a7\u202f701Mar. 15, 2022136 Stat. 889\n\u201cCongress finds the following:\u201c(1)", " Over 1 in 3 women experience sexual violence, and 1 in 5 women have survived completed or attempted rape. Such violence has a devastating impact on women\u2019s physical and emotional health, financial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic security.\u201c(2) Homicide is one of the leading causes of death for women on the job. Domestic partners or relatives commit 43 percent of workplace homicides against women. One study found that intimate partner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women at work in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a figure which represents 22 percent of the 648 workplace homicides among women during the period. In fact, in 2010, homicides against women at work increased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in overall workplace homicides in recent years.\u201c(3) Violence can have a dramatic impact on the survivor of such violence. Studies indicate that 44 percent of surveyed employed adults experienced the effect of domestic violence in the workplace, and 64 percent indicated their workplace performance was affected by such violence. Another recent survey found that 78 percent of offenders used workplace resources to express anger, check up on, pressure, or threaten a survivor. Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the workplace, can impair an employee\u2019s work performance, require time away from work, and undermine the employee\u2019s ability to maintain a job. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults.\u201c(4) Studies find that 60 percent of single women lack economic security and 81 percent of households with single mothers live in economic insecurity. Significant barriers that survivors confront include access to housing, transportation, and child care. Ninety-two percent of homeless women have experienced domestic violence, and more than 50 percent of such women cite domestic violence as the direct cause for homelessness. Survivors are deprived of their autonom", "y, liberty, and security, and face tremendous threats to their health and safety.\u201c(5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that survivors of severe intimate partner violence lose nearly 8,000,000 days of paid work, which is the equivalent of more than 32,000 full-time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of household productivity each year. Therefore, women disproportionately need time off to care for their health or to find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent further violence.\u201c(6) Annual costs of intimate partner violence are estimated to be more than $8,300,000,000. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the costs of intimate partner violence against women in 1995 exceeded an estimated $5,800,000,000. These costs included nearly $4,100,000,000 in the direct costs of medical and mental health care and nearly $1,800,000,000 in the indirect costs of lost productivity. These statistics are generally considered to be underestimated because the costs associated with the criminal justice system are not included.\u201c(7) Fifty-five percent of senior executives recently surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their company\u2019s productivity, and more than 70 percent said domestic violence negatively affects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of human resources professionals consider partner violence a workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of United States workplaces have no formal program or policy that addresses workplace violence, let alone domestic violence. In fact, only 4 percent of employers provided training on domestic violence.\u201c(8) Harassment is a persistent and significant problem in the workplace in the United States, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that not less than 25 percent, and as many as 85 percent, of women surveyed report having experienced sexual harassment at work.\u201c(9) For decades, survivors of sexual violence have come forward to seek justice and demand their right to", " be free from violence, harassment, and other forms of discrimination. These calls for change reached a tipping point after October 2017 as a result of Tarana Burke\u2019s work and #MeToo going viral. Thousands of courageous individuals, from Hollywood to the halls of Congress and the military, to restaurants, agricultural fields, and factory floors, shined a light on the pervasive and insidious nature of workplace harassment and sexual assault.\u201c(10) Working people can be subjected to multiple forms of harassment in the workplace at the same time.\u201c(11) According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, approximately 3 out of 4 individuals who experience harassment never talked to a supervisor, manager, or union representative about the harassing conduct.\u201c(12) The impact of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking on the workplace is a part of the challenge of workplace harassment.\u201c(13) Studies indicate that one of the best predictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay away from his or her abuser is the degree of his or her economic independence. However, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking often negatively impact a survivor\u2019s ability to maintain employment.\u201c(14) Abusers frequently seek to exert financial control over their partners by actively interfering with their ability to work, including preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their partners at work, limiting their partners\u2019 access to cash or transportation, and sabotaging their partners\u2019 child care arrangements.\u201c(15) Economic abuse refers to behaviors that control an intimate partner\u2019s ability to acquire, use, and maintain access to money, credit, ownership of assets, or governmental or private financial benefits, including defaulting on joint obligations (such as school loans, credit card debt, mortgages, or rent). Other forms of such abuse may include preventing someone from attending school, threatening to or actually terminating employment, controlling or withholding access t", "o cash, checking, or credit accounts, and attempting to damage or sabotage the creditworthiness of an intimate partner, including forcing an intimate partner to write bad checks, forcing an intimate partner to default on payments related to household needs, such as housing, or forcing an intimate partner into bankruptcy.\u201c(16) This title aims to empower survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to be free from violence, hardship, and control, which restrains basic human rights to freedom and safety in the United States.\u201d[For definitions of terms used in section 701 of div.
