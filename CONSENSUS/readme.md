Model Consensus Script

This file contains:

* a function to check what models are available
* a function to answer queries with all needed parameters
* a function to compare answers and check agreement
* a function to implement a consensus model
* and a loop to retry until consensus is reached

Put your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Run `main.py` or import the functions as needed.
